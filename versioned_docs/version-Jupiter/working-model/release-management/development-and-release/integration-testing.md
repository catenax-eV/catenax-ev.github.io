# Integration Testing

## Task

Integration testing pinpoints those communication issues between software components. It usually occurs after unit testing and before system testing.

## To Dos

- Components of the software are gradually integrated and tested as a unified group.
- Find defects that surface due to code conflicts between software modules when they are integrated with each other.

## Outcome

- Components are working well.
- No conflicts between software modules such as:
  - Incompatibility between subsystem versions.
  - Data format conflict.
  - Different processing logic.

## Timeline

- TBD
