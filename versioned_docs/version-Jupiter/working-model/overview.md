title: Overview

This working model is meticulously designed for members of our association and those involved in the various association bodies. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the organizational structure, the specific roles within the association, and the interrelation between Catena-X and Tractus-X. It includes detailed information on planning and building (Plan and Build), contrasting with the <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->[Operating model](../operating-model/why-introduction/why-introduction.md)<!-- markdown-link-check-enable --> that describes the model for the production/live environment (Run).

## Audience and Purpose

- **Association body members**: To delineate their specific roles and responsibilities within the association body ([Committees](./organizational-structure/catena-x/committee.md) and [Expert Groups](./organizational-structure/catena-x/expert-group.md)).
- **New members**: To facilitate a smooth onboarding process by explaining the association's framework.
- **Stakeholders and Contributors**: To guide those who wish to participate in the [creation or modification of standards](./process-structure/cx-from-idea-to-standard.md) or [contribute to the open-source initiatives](./process-structure/tx-from-idea-to-production.md) including other initiatives similar to Catena-X.

## Questions, Feedback and Contributions

If you have any questions, want to share feedback or want to contribute to the working model, you are welcome. In order to do so you have to options:

1. **Office hour**: The association offers a weekly office hour, that is open to all association members. The invitation is sent to all leads and co-leads, but can be forwarded to other association members.
2. **GitHub**: Discussions and Issues can be created in a specific <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->[GitHub repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-working-model)<!-- markdown-link-check-enable --> (The repository is only open to association members). All new content needs to be reviewed by the [association office](./organizational-structure/catena-x/catena-x-office.md).
