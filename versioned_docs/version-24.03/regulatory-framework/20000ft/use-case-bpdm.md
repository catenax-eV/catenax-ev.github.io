### KEY PRINCIPLES FOR BPDM ("USE CASE")

This document sets out the predefined use case framework ("**Framework**") for each participant in this Use Case ("Participant"). Partici- pants must agree to this Framework and make their data exchange legally binding by way of separate declarations. This document does not specify or restrict how Participants make such declarations.
Each Data Provider / Data Consumer (as a legal entity acting with proper authorization) must register for this Use Case in order to conclude data exchange contracts with the help of a registered connector.
Unless otherwise set out below, defined terms are those set out in the 10 Golden Rules.

### 1. KEY PARAMETERS

#### 1.1 WHO WITH WHOM?

[Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("**Access Policies**") to its data offers for one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number ("**BPN**").]

Participants are companies active in the CX Data Space (including, without limitation, companies providing core services ("**Operating Com- panies**")). For the sake of clarification and the purposes of this Use Case, Operating Companies may also function as Data Providers and/or Data Consumers.

#### 1.2 HOW, WHAT AND WHY?

[Data categories by (i) technical description and (ii) data quality parameters (if any)]

[Additional characteristics of data quality]

[Scope of usage right(s]]

> *Participants provide and use the data in compliance with the standards set by the Association [https://catena-x.net/en/standard-library](https://catena-x.net/en/standard-library): Unless otherwise agreed individually, Participants expressly exclude any requirements for quality, coherence, completeness of data; Data Provider provides data in its respective state "as is" and "as available".*
>
> *Data Consumer may use the data in line with the agreed purpose(s) and not for other purposes.*
>
> *For each data set, Participants may agree on the standardized purposes below ("**Predefined Purposes**").*
>
> *Data Provider may grant access and/or transfer the data to affiliates ((affiliated companies within the meaning of Section 15 German Stock Corporation Act, AktG, "**Affiliates**"), if Affiliates as Data Consumers submit to the rules under this Framework as applicable between Data Provider and Data Consumer.*
