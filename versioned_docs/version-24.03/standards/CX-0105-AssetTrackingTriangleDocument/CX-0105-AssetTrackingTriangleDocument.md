# CX-0105 Asset Tracking: Triangle Document 1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

The asset tracking use case aims to design a standard solution how diverse IoT solutions, available on the free market, can be incorporated into the Catena-X network keeping the interoperability and data sovereignty requirements respected. Although the main goal was always to track company assets with the various IoT devices, based on the set of standards designed by asset tracking use case team, there is a potential to fully use these in any use case in the Catena-X environment and beyond. The model opens the door for any IoT device manufacturer and any network provider to be part of the Catena-X network.

This standard focuses on the Asset Tracking Use Case. It includes relevant requirements for

- ATP (Asset Tracking Platform) as sensor data provider - standardized tool, please refer to standardization document "CX - 0070 Asset Tracking Platform API Standardization 1.0.0"
- Application/Dashboard as data consumer - non standardized tool

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

Please refer to: AUDIENCE & SCOPE.

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

This is the initial version of the standard.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

This document defines the so-called standardization triangle for the asset tracking use case.
Standardization triangle hereby means the mandatory components, data models, and APIs that are required to enable the asset tracking use case.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This document is meant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The Asset Tracking Platform aims to bring different IoT sensor networks to a standard Catena-X network and use sensor data for a variety of use cases, like:

- Logistics teams can track their returnable packages and assets at any time using geo data
- Use of automatic filling level measurements to drive efficient vendor-managed inventories
- Users (Tier suppliers, customers, carriers, insurers, etc.) are encouraged to monitor the quality of critical materials at any time during transportation

## Asset Tracking Platform- Component Overview

![Component Overview](./assets/ATP_Architecture_overview.png)

## Asset Tracking Platform- Process Flow Diagram

![ATP Architecture](./assets/ATP_Architecture.png)

**Components:**

**Asset Tracking Platform (Data Provider)**

The Asset Tracking Platform can be understood as a Hub that accepts data from IoT Networks, standardizes it, and enables it for Catena-X Components, Services, and Applications.

**Dashboard/Application (Data Consumer)**

A Dashboard/an Application can be used in the Catena-X Network to visualize sensor data from diverse IoT sensors.

It enables users to search & manage assets, devices, pairs & real-time tracking of assets using geo data sensors, optimizing vendor-managed inventories through automatic filling level measurements, allowing stakeholders Tiers, customers, carriers, insurers, etc.

**Networks**:

The Asset Tracking Platform can be understood as a Hub that accepts data from IoT Networks, standardizes it, and enables it for Catena-X Components, Services, and Applications.

**Business Partners**:

These are external entities, possibly suppliers, manufacturers, carriers, or other stakeholders, who are a part of the Catena-X network. They interact with the system to exchange data related to assets.

**EDC (Eclipse Dataspace Connector)**:

It's the central communication component for Catena-X that acts as a bridge between different data providers and consumers within the Catena-X ecosystem to implement a framework agreement for sovereign, cross-organizational data exchange. It ensures secure and standardized data exchange.

**dDTR (Decentralized Digital Twin registry)**:

It's a decentralized registry that lists all digital twins and references including information about the underlying asset, asset manufacturer, and access options, like aspect endpoints. Moreover, the dDTR is used to register and find data related to DTs.

**AAS (Asset Administration Shell) storage**:

It acts as a database for storing standardized device and sensor data. Devices that are paired/active can send their data to the ATP for standardization. The standardized data will be appended as a Submodel to the AAS of the parent IoT Device. The ATP normalizes the sensor data received from various IoT networks, creates an AAS model, and stores it in the AAS Storage component. It is used to describe an asset electronically in a standardized manner.

**Service discovery:**

It has the ability to map an EDC connector endpoint to a BPN.

**BPN Discovery Service:**

BPN discovery services help to restrict the number of EDCs to be accessed & it maps certain information to a business partner number (BPN). It helps the business application provider to identify the BPN of the data asset under consideration. e.g. to discover available EDC connectors.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to proof, that they conform to the Catena-X standards.
To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

#### 1.3.1 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is normative*

To proof conformity with the use case Asset Tracking:

1. An Asset Tracking Platform as a (sensor) data provider:

   - **MUST** be able to convert the device and received network data in standardized semantic data models (IotSensorData and IotSensorDeviceDefinition).
   - **MUST** register Digital Twins for IoT Sensor Devices with specific asset IDs (refer to 2.2 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS)

2. For an Asset Tracking Application as a data consumer:

   - **MUST** be able to link the digital twins of asset with one or multiple devices.
   - The consumption of standardized data **MUST** be done via the EDC.

## 4 APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

> *This section is normative*

### 4.1 ASSET TRACKING PLATFORM API

#### 4.1.1 PRECONDITIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

In order to persist the necessary data, a persistence module, specifically a database, is REQUIRED by the ATP. In there, the ATP stores the API Keys and Device Registry Entries that help with associating a devices network and Catena-X information.

Communication with an IoT network is established via HTTP requests. By doing so, users can request non-standardized data from the respective network.

All standardized data, including the digital representation of an IoT device (Digital Twins, Shell Descriptors) and its data, is provided as a submodel via a submodel server. This data is accessible via an EDC. Therefore, when providing and exchanging data to the Catena-X network, an EDC is REQUIRED. The same is applicable for consuming the data, as access to the provided data is also granted via an EDC. Therefore, when consuming data from the ATP, an EDC is also REQUIRED.

To make the data discoverable in the Catena-X network, a Shell Descriptor MUST be created. Therefore, a decentralized DTR instance is REQUIRED.

#### 4.1.2 API SPECIFICATION

For the complete API Specification please refer to CX-0070-Asset-Tracking-Platform-API-Standardization-1.0.0.

#### 4.1.3 EDC DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

ATP provides the specific data objects as data assets via an EDC.
