# CX-0093 Aspect Model: Traction Battery Code v1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

The semantic model described below describes a submodel for a digital twin of a traction battery or a respective subcomponent (pack, module or cell). This aspect model provides information about the traction battery code of a battery component. A traction battery code is an identification code according to GB/T 34014-2017 which has to be provided when exporting automotive traction batteries to the People's Republic of China. Additionally the model provides information about the type of the component.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

This standardization introduces the standardized aspect model for traction battery codes according to GB/T 34014-2017 with corresponding JSON schemas and payloads for guidance and orientation on how to provision and exchange the corresponding data within Catena-X.

Note: The presented aspect model is in version 1.0.0.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard applies to the roles:

This standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider
  
### 1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

This aspect model is used in the context of the Catena-X use case Traceability aims on connecting the data chain by building relations between the digital twins of parts across company boundaries.
The TractionBatteryCode aspect model is used to provide the identification codes accoring the GB/T 34014-2017 which has to be provided when exporting automotive traction batteries to the People's Republic of China. These codes are needed on the level of the traction battery cell, module and pack.
On the lowest level, the cell level, the model contains only the traction battery code for the cell and the information on the classification which describes if the corresponding part is a cell, a module or a pack. On the middle level, the module level, the model contains the same information for the module (code and classification). In addition to that, however, it also includes a list of the cells information that are assembled into the module. Analogue to this, on pack level, the model contains the information of the pack itself as well as the information of the modules assembled into the pack and the cells assembled into the modules.
By accessing this aspect you can get all traction battery codes that are a part of the corresponding part of the traction battery.

### 1.4 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams,
examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in
this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**,
**REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.5 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

All participants* and their solutions MUST proof, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

The proof of conformity for a single semantic model is done according to the general rules for proving the conformity of data provided to a semantic model or the ability to consume the corresponding data.  

*Disclaimer: The operating model released by the Catena-X association will define the roadmap, content and scope for the certification process. This will include the roles, certification and further assessment procedures as well as the rollout phases*.

### 1.7 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

Aspect Model
: a formal, machine-readable semantic description (expressed with RDF/turtle) of data accessible from an Aspect.

: Note 1 to entry: An Aspect Model must adhere to the Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM), i.e., it utilizes elements and relations defined in the Semantic Aspect Meta Model and is compliant to the validity rules defined by the Semantic Aspect Meta Model.  

: Note 2 to entry: Aspect model are logical data models which can be used to detail a conceptual model in order to describe the semantics of runtime data related to a concept. Further, elements of an Aspect model can/should refer to terms of a standardized Business Glossary (if existing).

*[Source: Catena-X, CX-0002, note 3 removed]*

This Catena-X data model is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0) license, which is available at Creative Commons.

### 2.4 IDENTIFER OF SEMANTIC MODEL

The semantic model has the unique identifier

**urn:bamm:io.catenax.traction_battery_code:1.0.0#TractionBatteryCode**

### 2.5 FORMATS OF SEMANTIC MODEL

#### 2.5.1 RDF Turtle

The rdf turtle file, an instance of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, is the master for generating additional file formats and serializations.

https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.traction_battery_code/1.0.0/TractionBatteryCode.ttl

The open source command line tool of the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework  is used for generation
of other file formats like for example a JSON Schema, aasx for Asset Administration Shell Submodel
Template or a HTML documentation.

#### 2.5.2 JSON Schema

A JSON Schema can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The JSON Schema defines the Value-Only
payload of the Asset Administration Shell for the API operation "GetSubmodel".

#### 2.5.3 aasx

An AASX file can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The AASX file defines one of the requested
artifacts for a Submodel Template Specification conformant to \[[SMT](#32-non-normative-references)].
