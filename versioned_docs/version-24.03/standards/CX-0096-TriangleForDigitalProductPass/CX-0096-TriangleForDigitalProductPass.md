# CX-0096 Triangle For Digital Product Pass v1.1.0

## ABSTRACT

This standard focuses on the digital product passport use case. This includes relevant requirements for

- data provider, that want to provide different passports through Catena-X,
- data consumer, that are searching for different passports in Catena-X, and
- application developer / provider supporting the provisioning and consuming of passport data.

Specific passports that shall be mentioned here are the battery passport and the transmission passport, which are first realizations of product passports in Catena-X.

In this document, keywords for registering and searching digital twins and their passports
submodels are defined.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

This document defines the so-called *standardization triangle* for the digital product passport use case.
Standardization triangle hereby means the mandatory components, data models, APIs etc.
that are required to enable the digital product passport use case. Additionally,
search objects as well as procedures to registering / providing and consuming the data will be defined.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This document is meant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

The standard is of interest to all members of the automotive supply chain including suppliers, OEMs, dismantler, recyclers and stakeholders within the recycling industry and the circular economy.

Additionally, the standards also apply to software providers and core service providers to ensure interoperability and data sovereignty between different core service providers. The scope of this standard is to define mandatory components, logics and data models as well as give guidance for the provisioning and consuming of product pass information.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

Manufacturer will have to provide information on different aspects of their products.
These information will be stored in so-called passports, providing information on instances of the product.

Different stakeholders shall be able to read these passports such as legal authorities, dismantler,
as well as the owner of the product in sense of public persons.

This standards defines the basic interactions with passport information as standard for the
use case "digital product passport". It is implemented in a first reference application which
can be found in section [3.3 REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION](#33-reference-implementations).

### 1.3 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

> *This section is non-normative*

This image depicts an overall image of the architecture this standard relates to. Further information can be  read in the [Eco Pass KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Eco_Pass_KIT/page-adoption-view).
The standards related to these components are mentioned in [2.1 LIST OF STANDALONE STANDARDS](#21-list-of-standalone-standards).
Further architecture diagrams for the interactions are presented in [FIGURES](#figures).

#### 2.3.3 Searching for Decentralized Digital Twin Registries

To find decentralized Digital Twin Registries of related parties in Catena-X, app provider **MUST** follow the [CX-0002](#21-list-of-standalone-standards) Standard.

#### 2.3.4 Registration at the BPN Discovery Service

To find the Business Partner Number of the related parties in Catena-X, data provider **MUST** follow the [CX-0053](#21-list-of-standalone-standards) standard. Example can be found in the [Digital Twin Kit](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Digital%20Twin%20Kit/Software%20Development%20View/Specification%20Digital%20Twin%20KIT)

In specific, as a data provider you **MUST** register the ``manufacturerPartId`` following the
  Catena-X standard [CX-0002](#21-list-of-standalone-standards) at the BPN Discovery Service.
  The BPN is hand-over by the authentication/authorization token. Only the owner of a BPN can link the ``manufacturerPartId`` to their BPN.

  An example can be found here: [Digital Twin Kit - API BPN Discovery](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Digital%20Twin%20Kit/Software%20Development%20View/API%20BPN%20Discovery/post-bpn-discovery)
  
**Example**

```text
POST /api/administration/connectors/bpnDiscovery
```

```json
{
  "type": "manufacturerPartId", 
  "key": "12345678910"
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "type": "manufacturerPartId",
  "key": "12345678910",
  "value": "bpn-123",
  "resourceId": "1ca6f9b5-8e1d-422a-8541-9bb2cf5fe485"
}
```

As an app provider / data consumer you **MUST** use the ``manufacturerPartId`` to search for related BPN endpoints.
  An example can be found here: [Digital Twin Kit - API BPN Discovery](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Digital%20Twin%20Kit/Software%20Development%20View/API%20BPN%20Discovery/get-bpn-discoveries)

**Example**

```

```json
{
  "searchFilter": [
    {
      "type": "manufacturerPartId",
      "keys": [
        "12345678910"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

**Response**

```json
{
  "bpns": [
    {
      "type": "manufacturerPartId",
      "key": "12345678910",
      "value": "bpn-123",
      "resourceId": "1ca6f9b5-8e1d-422a-8541-9bb2cf5fe485"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2.3.5 Registration of the Digital Twin and the Submodels in the Digital Twin Registry

A data provider **MUST** register their AAS of the product with the following values for the ``idShort``:

- for batteries: ``Battery_{{PartInstanceId}}``
- for transmissions: ``Transmission_{{PartInstanceId}}``

For other product types the format ``{{Product Name}}_{{PartInstanceId}}`` **SHOULD** be used.

Additionally, the AAS **MUST** be registered with ``specificAssetIds: partInstanceId`` and depending on the current lifecyclePhase of the product with

- ``assetLifecyclePhase = AsBuild`` for product that already have been build or
- ``assetLifecyclePhase = AsPlanned`` for products not yet build.
  
When describing ``asPlanned`` information, ``ExternalReference`` has to be set to ``PUBLIC_READABLE`` as described in the [Digital Twin Registry documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-digital-twin-registry/tree/main/docs)

**Example of a battery in as-planned lifecycle stage:**

```json
"idShort": "Battery_{{PartInstanceId}}",
"specificAssetIds": [
  {
    "name": "manufacturerPartId",
    "value": "{{manufacturerPartId}}",
    "externalSubjectId": {
      "type": "ExternalReference",
      "keys": [
        {
          "type": "GlobalReference",
          "value": "BPNL000000000000"
        },
        {
          "type": "GlobalReference",
          "value": "PUBLIC_READABLE"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "partInstanceId",
    "value": "{{PartInstanceId}}",
    "externalSubjectId": {
      "type": "ExternalReference",
      "keys": [
        {
          "type": "GlobalReference",
          "value": "{{BPN of partner}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "key" : "assetLifecyclePhase",
    "value": "AsPlanned"
  }
]
```

Data provider **MUST** provide their product passport information in the ``submodelDescriptors`` depending on their product with the following information:

| Product type | used data model | mandatory ``idShort``|
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Batteries |BatteryPass ([CX-0034](#22-data-required)) |  ``batteryPass`` |
| Transmissions | Transmission Pass ([CX-0095](#22-data-required)) | ``transmissionPass`` |
|  Generic Passport | Digital Product Pass ([CX-103 Aspect Model Digital Product Passport](#22-data-required)) |``digitalProductPass`` |

- The data provider also **MUST** provide a API Endpoint following the [CX-0002](#21-list-of-standalone-standards).
Data-  provider **MUST** register the related sub-models as shown in the example below.
- The id added to the ``subprotocolBody`` **SHOULD** be a UUIDv4.
- The ``href`` definition follows [CX-0002](#21-list-of-standalone-standards)

**Example of a transmission:**

```json
"submodelDescriptors":[
  {
    "endpoints": [
      {
        "interface": "SUBMODEL-3.0",
        "protocolInformation": {
