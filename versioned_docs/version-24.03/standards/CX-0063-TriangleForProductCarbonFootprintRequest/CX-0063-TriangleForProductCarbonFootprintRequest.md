# CX-0063 Triangle for Product Carbon Footprint Request v2.1.0

## ABSTRACT

This standard focuses on the pcf exchange use case. This includes relevant requirements for:

- data provider, that want to provide pcf data through Catena-X,

- data consumer, that are want to consume pcf values in Catena-X and

- Application developer/provider supporting the provisioning and consuming of pcf values.
It will provide information about the used core components as well as the structure of the Digital
Twin Registry entry and the EDC data structure.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

In an increasingly environmentally conscious world, the standardized exchange of
product carbon footprint data is becoming increasingly important.
The PCF refers to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated during the manufacture,
use and disposal of a product.
The exchange of data between companies in Catena X makes it possible to measure, compare and reduce
the environmental impact of products.
A standardized exchange of PCF data is therefore of great importance to promote more sustainable and
environmentally friendly production and consumption

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

List for which roles the standard is relevant:

- Data Provider / Consumer
  
- Business Application Provider

This documents shows how the pcf exchange in Catena X takes place and which standards needs to
fulfill to be interoperable in the Catena X Network.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

This document defines the so-called *standardization triangle* for the pcf exchange use case.
Standardization triangle hereby means the mandatory components, data models, APIs etc. that are
required to enable the pcf exchange use case.
Additionally, search objects as well as procedures to registering/providing and consuming
the data will be defined.

**Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)**
The balance of greenhouse gas emissions along the entire life cycle of a product in a defined
 application and in relation to a defined unit of use.

**Business Partner Number (BPN)**
: A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-x
Additional terminology used in this standard can be looked up in the glossary on the association homepage.

#### 2.2.1 On Boarding and IAM

All participant mentioned under [1.1](#11-audience--scope) MUST follow the CX Standards [CX-0006 RegistrationAndInitialOnBoarding, CX-0013 Identity of Member Companies, CX-0014 Employees and Technical Users, CX-0016 Company Attribute Verification, CX-0017 Company Role by the Connector](#21-list-of-standalone-standards).

#### 2.2.2 Fetching EDC Endpoints

To find the EDC Endpoint addresses of related parties in Catena-X, App Provider MUST follow the
[CX-0001 EDC Discovery API](#21-list-of-standalone-standards) Standard.

#### 2.2.3 Searching for decentralized Digital Twin Registries

To find decentralized Digital Twin Registries of related parties in Catena-X, App Provider MUST
follow the
[CX-0002 Digital Twins in Catena](#21-list-of-standalone-standards) Standard.

#### 2.2.4 Registration at the BPN Discovery Service

>**Note**
Not needed for PCF as the BPN is known by the Application

#### 2.2.5 Registration of the Digital Twin and the PCF Submodel in the Digital Twin Registry

With Release 23-09 the PCF use case changed to the AAS logic.
Therefore Digital Twins SHOULD be registered in the decentralized digital twin registry.
For looking up the twin ID the data provider MUST register the twins
with the specificAssetIds ``manufacturerPartId`` and ``assetLifecyclePhase=AsPlanned``. In addition the specificAssetId ``digitalTwinType=PartType`` SHOULD be registered to prepare compatibility with future versions. Be aware that the use of ``assetLifecyclePhase=AsPlanned`` will be removed in future versions and usage of ``digitalTwinType=PartType`` will become mandatory instead.

```json
    "specificAssetIds": [
        {
            "key": "manufacturerPartId",
            "value": "%%PART-ID%%"
        },
        {
            "key": "assetLifecyclePhase",
            "value": "AsPlanned"
        },
        {
            "key": "digitalTwinType",
            "value": "PartType"
        }
    ],
```

- The data provider also MUST provide a API Endpoint following the [CX-0002 Digital Twins in Catena](#21-list-of-standalone-standards).
- Data provider MUST register the related pcf sub-model as shown in the [example](#224-registration-at-the-bpn-discovery-service) below.
- The sub model MUST be registered with the ``"idShort": "PCFExchangeEndpoint"``
- For Release 3.2 the subprotocolBody for pcf exchange MUST be defined  like the following description ``"subprotocolBody": "id=AssetId_of_EDCasset;dspEndpoint=https://some.controlplane.url:7173"``
- The id added to the subprotocolBody SHOULD be a UUIDv4
- The ``href`` definition follows [CX-0002 CX-0002 Digital Twins in Catena](#21-list-of-standalone-standards) and MUST have the following structure: "https://edc.data.plane/productIds/mat345" (URL to use via EDC Proxy Call to request PCF).

> NOTE
  Replace "edc.data.plane" with the locally needed URL parts to do a EDC proxy call.

```json
{
    "description": [
        {
            "language": "en",
            "text": "PCF endpoint for material 'mat345'"
        }
    ],
    "idShort": "PCFExchangeEndpoint",
    "identification": "urn:uuid:205cf8d1-8f07-483c-9c5b-c8d706c7d05d",
    "semanticId": {
        "value": [
            "urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:5.0.0#Pcf"
        ]
    },
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "interface": "PCF-1.0.0",
            "protocolInformation": {
                "href": "https://edc.data.plane/productIds/mat345",
                "endpointProtocol": "HTTP",
                "endpointProtocolVersion": ["1.1"],
                "subprotocol": "DSP",
                "subprotocolBody": "id=c34018ab-5820-4065-9087-416d78e1ab60;dspEndpoint=https://some.controlplane.url:7173",
                "subprotocolBodyEncoding": "plain"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### 2.2.6 Requesting a PCF without an existing Digital Twin or PCF Submodel

In case no Digital Twin or PCF Submodel is registered (yet), the asset to use is identified by its type (``data.pcf.exchangeEndpoint``).

#### 2.2.7 EDC Data Asset Structure

##### 2.2.7.1 EDC Data Asset

The PCF asset MUST be registered with as defined below:

```json
{
  "@type": "edc:AssetEntryDto",
  "edc:asset": {

    "edc:properties": {
      "rdfs:label": "PCF Data",
      "rdfs:comment": "Endpoint for PCF data",
      "dcat:version": "1.0.0", 
      "cx-common:version": "1.0.0",
