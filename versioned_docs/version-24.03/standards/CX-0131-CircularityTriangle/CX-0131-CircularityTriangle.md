# CX-0131 Circularity Triangle v1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

The Circularity KIT shall empower stakeholders to transition towards a circular economy by providing frameworks, guidelines and best practices to enhance sustainability credentials, enable data-driven decision-making and foster collaboration and innovation in the automotive industry.
Secondary Material Content (SMC), Material Accounting (MA), End-of-Life (EoL) and Dismantling Services, and the CE-Assistant are the four focus topics that form the first version of the Circularity KIT. The offered content and artifacts address important use cases such as sustainable material management, waste minimization and resource efficiency, that contribute to more sustainable and circular automotive value loops.
The overarching goals of the Circularity KIT, therefore, are to:

- Establish an understanding of requirements along circular value chains and how businesses
  can profit by implementing  sustainable solutions
- Offer standards and guidelines for industry stakeholders
- Create the basis for data exchange and applications to ensure the provided frameworks are used in the intended way
- Explain different circularity topics and provide tools to implement them

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Within Circular Economy it is of utmost importance that any of the partners in the supply chain work closely together and share relevant information that they can provide. Due to the loops in the supply chain the role allocation of suppliers and customers is not as clear as in linear economy. Therefore, it is crucial within Circular Economy to understand the processes, conditions, connections, transitions, and temporal aspects of materials, parts, and vehicles. This involves navigating the complexities of End-of-Life considerations, R-Strategy Assistance, Material Accounting, and Secondary Material Content. Efficiently managing resources and strategically addressing end-of-life phases are integral to fostering sustainability in a closed-loop system.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

*This section is non-normative*

List for which roles the standard is relevant:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

The standard is of interest to all members of the automotive supply chain including suppliers, OEMs, dismantler, recyclers and stakeholders within the recycling industry and the circular economy.

Additionally, the standards also apply to software providers and core service providers to ensure interoperability and data sovereignty between different core service providers. The scope of this document is to provide guidance about the different standards in the Circularity KIT use case.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

In order to effectively enhance circularity along the supply chain, standardized approaches to different aspects of circular economy are essential. This covers the usage of Secondary Material Content, Material Accounting, the CE-Assistant as well as the complexities of End-of-Life and Dismantling Services. The standardization provides structured frameworks based on which information can be shared across industries and stakeholders. Therefore, it enhances comparability between companies and, by reducing the chance of misunderstandings, increases data quality.

The issuance of a 'Certificate of Decommissioning' (CoDM) by an authorized dismantling company classifies a vehicle and all associated components as End-of-Life. The issuance of the certificate is exclusively handled by a company within Catena-X holding the CX-verifiable credential 'Dismantler.' Therefore, the CoDM consistently marks the conclusion of the initial lifecycle phase of an asset, initiating the End-of-Life process. Subsequently, additional certificates provide the opportunity to commence the start of a component's second life. However, a vehicle with a specific VIN is unequivocally designated as End-of-Life. The End-of-Life-Vehicle (ELV) will be consecutive dismantled. The CE-Assistant can then be used to support the dismantling company in its decision as to which components of the ELV should be reused, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled. The assistant suggests the most ecologically and economically beneficial R-strategy for the components. The asset/part/component/material/fluid/etc. must be certified - reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishment, material recycling, waste - in accordance with the decision made. This certification makes it possible to track the life cycle of the components precisely. It also offers the advantage of being able to keep statistics on what percentage of its components have been allocated to which R-strategy. In the evaluation of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of different components and their subsequent integration into the digital twin, the precise categorization of these components across different life cycle phases is a central factor. The utilization of precisely defined end-of-life (EoL) certificates enables the accurate determination of a component's current life cycle phase. This precision not only ensures a reliable assessment, but also facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact and carbon footprint of the components, seamlessly integrating this valuable information into the digital twin framework. The dismantling process is carried out in accordance with all legal requirements (e.g. documentation of pollutant removal, etc.). The vehicle is then dismantled and individual materials are separated.

The separated assets are part of further processing by any R-strategy. The second life of the asset might be Re-Use, Re-Pair, Re-Manufacture or Re-Cycle. Depending on the exact R-Strategy different data might be interesting for the second life of the asset.

Material Accounting provides standardized scrap/waste and secondary material data exchange for the ecosystem partners to create transparency about recycling activities and verifiable closed loops.

To close the loops and to understand the usage of the materials provided through the previous steps, Secondary Material Content (SMC) explores ways to incorporate secondary materials into the value chain. By facilitating a standardized data model for data exchange and introducing a calculation methodology, this framework establishes a foundation to facilitate communication between stakeholders. Through this, the secondary materials are being brought back into the loop.
Those materials are processed into new products and after entering the EoL-phase the loop is closed.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.
The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.4 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

All participants and their solutions will need to proof, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). Please refer to the [certification information page](https://catenax.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/certification) for the process of conformity assessment and certification.
Since this Triangle document describes a set of standards to be fulfilled, participants MUST fulfill all mentioned standards for the relevant sub-usecase ([2.3](#23-secondary-material-content), [2.4](#24-eol--dismantling-services), [2.5](#25-ce-assistant)) and the respective conformity assessment criteria in addition to the specific criteria mentioned in this document. The specific criteria described in this document are describing the usage of the central tools as well as common tools described in the linked standardization documents and therefore compliance should be checked with the tools provided for these components.

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY
