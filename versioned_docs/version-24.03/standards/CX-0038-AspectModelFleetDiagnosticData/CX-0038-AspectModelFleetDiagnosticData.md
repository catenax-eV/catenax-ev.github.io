# CX-0038 Aspect Model: Fleet Diagnostic Data v1.0.2

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the semantic model "Fleet Diagnostic Data" used
in the Catena-X network.

### 1.1 Audience & Scope

> *This section is non-normative*

The described semantic model is relevant for:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

### 1.2 Context

> *This section is non-normative*

The Catena-X use case Live Quality Loops (QAX) uses multiple data models
to exchange data between automotive manufacturer (OEM) and component
supplier (TIER1). Each of these data models can be supplied
independently.

The Fleet.DiagnosticData model is used to exchange vehicle diagnostic
data coming from multiple vehicles that are affected by a Catena-X
QualityTask. For investigation also diagnostic data from similar
vehicles that are not affected by a Catena-X QualityTask
is exchanged.

### 1.3 Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams,
examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in
this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**,
**REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.4 Proof of conformity

> *This section is non-normative*

All participants and their solutions will need to prove they conform
with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied
correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

A model validator must be created, to prove the correctness of the data
model. A generic test set created for the model must prove the expected
results\

## 2. Aspect Model Fleet Diagnostic Data

### 2.1 Introduction

Catena-X use case "Live Quality Loops"(QAX) uses several Catena-X
standardized data models to exchange data:

![Hierarchy of Catena-X data models used in QAX](./assets/CX-0038-hierarchy-of-CX-data-models-used-in-QAX.png)

***Figure 1: Hierarchy of Catena-X data models used in QAX***

Data models in QAX and their content:

- QualityTask is the root element and describes why companies are working together on a quality topic and what they want to do. All involved companies and their contact people are named. In addition, a flag tells what should be done with exchanged data after a QualityTask is closed.
- Vehicle.ProductDescription: This data model is a representation of one vehicle affected by this QualityTask. The model represents the vehicle when it was sold to the end-customers from an end-customers point of view: Which standard equipment was installed in the vehicle and which extra equipment was installed in the vehicle.
- Fleet.DiagnosticData: Diagnostic data coming from multiple vehicles that are affected by this QualityTask + Diagnostic data from similar vehicles that are not affected by this QualityTask.
- Fleet.ClaimData: Customer complaints that are linked to this QualityTask + Data about the exchange of potentially faulty parts
- ManufacturedPartsQualityInformation: A selection of manufacturing-related parameters that help to solve the QualtiyTask
- PartsAnalyses: Analyses results of replaced and potentially faulty parts that are linked to this QualityTask

### 2.2 Normative Criteria

The usage of the described semantic model "Fleet Diagnostic Data" is a
MUST for Data Provider and Data Consumer that want to work together on a
quality topic over Catena-X automotive network.

#### 2.2.1 Normative criteria for Data Provider

Every data provider MUST provide the data conformant to the semantic
model specified in CX-0038.

It is a MUST to provide a unique sessionId. This sessionId MUST be
unique in the data provider's company.

It is a MUST to provide the property "anonymizedVIN". anonymizedVIN MUST
match with anonymizedVIN property of Vehicle Product Description in CX
-- 0037.

It is a MUST to provide the property "qualityTaskId". qualityTaskId MUST
match with qualityTaskId property of Quality Task in CX -- 0036.

If available property catenaXId of entity ECU and property catenaXId of
entity Vehicle SHOULD be provided.

In the Catena-X data space "Fleet Diagnostic Data" MUST be exchanged via
Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) conformant to CX-0018.

It is RECOMMEND to use Apache parquet[^3] file format together with EDC
S3 data plane for file data exchange "Fleet Diagnostic Data".

#### 2.2.2 Normative criteria for Business Application Provider

It is a MUST for Business Application Provider to support at least 2
standardized Catena-X QAX aspect models from Catena-X Release 3.0 (2 out
of Catena-X standards CX -- 0036, CX -- 0037, CX -- 0038, CX -- 0039, CX
-- 0040, CX -- 0041) to get the label "Catena-X Certified Solution" for
their quality application.

It is RECOMMEND for Business Application Provider to be able to read the
semantic model "Fleet Diagnostic Data".

### 2.3 License

This Catena-X data model is an outcome of Catena-X use case group Live
Quality Loops (QAX). This Catena-X data model is made available under
the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
(CC-BY-4.0) license, which is available at Creative Commons[^4].

The license information is available in github.

In case of doubt the license, copyright and authors information in
github overwrites the information in this specification document.

### 2.4 Identifer of Semantic Model

This semantic model has the unique identifier

urn:bamm:io.catenax.fleet.diagnostic_data:1.0.0

### 2.5 Formats of Semantic Model

#### 2.5.1 RDF Turtle

The rdf turtle file, adhering to the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, is the
master for generating additional file formats and serializations. It is
provided here:

https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.fleet.diagnostic_data/1.0.0

The open source command line tool of the Eclipse Semantic Modeling
Framework[^5] is used for generation of other file formats like
for example a JSON Schema, aasx for Asset Administration Shell Submodel
Template or a HTML documentation.

#### 2.5.2 JSON Schema

A JSON Schema can be generated from the RDF Turtle file using the
Eclipse ESMF tooling. The JSON Schema defines the Value-Only payload of
the Asset Administration Shell for the API operation \"GetSubmodel\".

If present, example JSON-payloads MUST validate against the generated
JSON schema.
