# CX-0069 Shop-Floor-Information-Service Aspect Model v1.0.0

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

## ABSTRACT

A Modular Production is part of the value chain. It therefore has to guarantee flexibility and availability on one hand and on the other hand it has to allow product flexibility together with small lot sizes. The effect of disturbances and decision in this network are not limited to a local area, but they have also a big impact to other partners in the value chain network. It is therefore necessary to communicate values from the shop floor directly to other members of the network like the customers or their substitutes like logisticians. This communication is realized with the Shop-Floor-Information-Service (SIS).
For example a costumer wants to know the estimated date of production, he can therefore use the Shop-Floor-Information-Service to get the information either directly, via cyclic messages or notifications in case of changing calculated production dates. The Shop-Floor-Information-Service uses the GetProductionForecastInformation model and the ProvideProductionForecastInformation model.
This mechanism is reflected following the Shop-Floor-Information API.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for

- Business Application Providers:  their role is the implementation of the Shop-Floor-Information-Service
- Data  Providers: mainly modular productions - they have to provide the data necessary for the Shop-Floor-Information-Service
- Data Consumers: e.g. tier n-1 factories, end customers or logisticians, they have to be able to process the data provided by the Shop-Floor-Information-Service

Stakeholders within Catena-X

- PURIS, DCM: capacity planning requires a forecast of the delivered products
- OSIM: the Forecast Data of the SIS can serve as input for a OSIM-simulation

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

Higher-level, external influencing factors from the supply chain, such as delays in the logistics chain for supplier parts or short-term order changes, may invalidate a production plan that has already been drawn up. Today, such short-term changes in the general conditions of the production process can often only be taken into consideration indirectly and made through manual corrections. The solution approaches in the modular production use case are aimed at increasing the flexibility of production to better leverage the existing business potential. For this purpose, services, interface, and data model definitions based on industry standards are offered with the goal of increasing the flexibility and reliability of industrial production. The shop floor is networked with the Catena-X network via the connectors standardized in Catena-X. Modular production  will offer a Shop-Floor-Information-Service  that supplies information about the production status and planning as needed by other use cases. The goal here is to enable individual production (batch size 1) at the price of series production. In particular, this is to be achieved by automating the orchestration of production resources and planning of production processes as much as possible, thus significantly reducing effort and planning times. A growth in efficiency in the sense of the OEE is achieved in that production can be reconfigured in the event of faults to continue operating as well as possible. The increased flexibility creates the space for new business models, such as the interposition of highly prioritized, lucrative orders. As a consequence not only the production is required to be flexible and fast reactive to changes, it also requires  communication of future factory output to the customers.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams,
examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in
this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**,
**REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).
The proof of conformity for a single semantic model is done according to the general rules for proving the conformity of data provided to a semantic model or the ability to consume the corresponding data.

This Catena-X data model is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0) license, which is available at Creative Commons.

The ProvideProductionForecastInformation model is described in detail in the following table:

|Field|Purpose|Datatype|Example Value|
|-|-|-|-|
|versionDataModel|version of the data model|string|urn:samm:io.catenax.shared.shopfloor_information_types:1.0.0|
|communicationMode|Enum describing if synchronous, cyclic or notification is used for data exchange|enum|synchronous|
|timeValue|dataFormat for storing timeValues|TimeValue [EnumTimeUnits, uint ]|\{ "timeUnit": "day", "value": 3\}|

Communication Mode MUST be one of the following items: synchronous, cyclic and notification

EnumTimeUnits MUST be one of the following items: unit:secondUnitOfTime, unit:minuteUnitOfTime, unit:hour, unit:day, unit:week, unit:month, unit:year
