# CX-0123 Quality Use Case Standard v1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

```text
    The Catena-X use case "Quality" (QAX) provides the ability to detect
    quality issues the earliest possible to start root cause analyses and/or to enable
    an early warning feature for new quality topics. In subsequent steps, counter
    measures can also be defined earlier and monitored. In sum, this reduces the
    number of vehicles affected by quality issues and increases the availability of the
    vehicle and built-in components. Catena-X use case "Quality" is powered
    by Catena-X standard core components to share data from OEM and suppliers
    based on data sharing agreements and usage policies.
```

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

```text
    See section Audience & Scope
```

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

```text
    This is the initial version of the standard
```

## 1 INTRODUCTION

```text
    The Catena-X use case "Quality" (QAX) uses multiple data models to
    exchange data between automotive manufacturer (OEM) and component supplier
    (TIER1). Each of these data models can be supplied independently.
    The QualityTask data model defines the root element for Catena-X-based quality
    work. It describes the quality task and why two companies want to work
    collaboratively on a quality topic.
```

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

```text
    The standard is relevant for the following roles within the scope of the Use Case "Quality"
        * Data Provider/Consumer
        * Business Application Provider
    
    In scope:
    
    - Data sharing between OEM, Tier1 and Tier n
    - Earliest possible detection of potential issues with products and vehicles in usage
    - Understanding of the root cause of the detected issues to enable earliest possible counter measure implementation
```

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

```text
For all participants of the Use Case "Quality" it is necessary to provide and consume the data in accordance to the standardized semantic data models in section [3 Aspect Models](#3-aspect-mordels) to ensure the defined interoperability requirement "free of choice application" to be able to use the established inhouse tool set for analysis.

Catena-X use case "Quality" data flow: Data is exported from existing backend systems and mapped to Catena-X aspect models - see list of relevant Catena-X aspect models for use case "Quality" in section [3 Aspect Models](#3-aspect-mordels)
The so generated files are transferred between different Catena-X participants using Catena-X' Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC).

In order to participate in the Catena-X use case "Quality" the following single standards **MUST** be fulfilled by all participants:

CX - 0018 Eclipse Data Connector (EDC) v2.1.0  

As OEM data provider I **MUST** align to the following aspect models in the corresponding data exchange:

Aspect Model QualityTask  v1.0.0
Aspect Model VehicleProductDescription  v3.0.0
Aspect Model FleetDiagnosticData  v1.0.0
Aspect Model FleetClaimData  v1.0.0
Aspect Model FleetVehicles v1.0.0
Aspect Model QualityTaskAttachment v1.0.0

As Supplier data provider I **MUST** align to the following aspect models in the corresponding data exchange:

Aspect Model QualityTask  v1.0.0
Aspect Model PartAnalyses  v2.0.0
Aspect Model ManufacturedPartsQualityInformation  v1.0.0
Aspect Model QualityTaskAttachment v1.0.0

- Data provisioning and consuming **MUST** be done according the standardized semantic data models.
- The data provider defines the data content that will be provided. Provided data assets are defined in data sharing agreements and/or data usage policies.

As Business Application Provider I **MUST** support at least 2 aspect models (minimum standard): One from OEM data provider aspect model list and one from Supplier data provider aspect model list.

```

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

```text
    As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
    in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

    The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
    and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

    All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards.
    To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).
    
    Since this Use Case Quality Standard describes a set of standards to be fulfilled, participants MUST fulfill all
    mentioned standards and the respective conformity assessment criteria in addition to the specific criteria mentioned in
    this document.
    
    The specific criteria described in this document are describing the usage of the central tools as well as common tools
    described in the linked standardization documents and therefore compliance should be checked with the tools provided
    for these components.
```
