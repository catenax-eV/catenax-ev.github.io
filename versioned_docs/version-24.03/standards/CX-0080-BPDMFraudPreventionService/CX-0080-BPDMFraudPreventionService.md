# CX–0080 Fraud Prevention Service v1.0.0

## **ABSTRACT**

Digital fraud risks are constantly increasing, e.g., in the form of fake invoices sent in the name of real suppliers, but with third-party (fraudster) account data.
The Fraud Prevention Service provides information on most recent fraud cases which have been shared within the Catena-X (CX) network by contributing companies.
It therefore benefits from the overall idea of data sharing within the Catena-X community as such information is nowhere available in any data source accessible along the automotive supply chain.

There is a strong need to create such a reliable data source by anonymously sharing fraud details within the CX member network.

This data shall be made accessible and consumable via dashboard & reporting functionalities.

By using this information, the CX community has the chance to prevent fraud cases in their own companies as they can use shared data about e.g., fraudulent bank accounts to stop payments and so avoid financial losses and reputation damage.

The purpose of this standard is to describe guidelines and requirements specific for the challenges of fraud risks in order to minimize such threats and implications for the own company.  It focuses on fraudulent bank data as the most common fraud type although other relevant fraud types are also considered.

## **1 INTRODUCTION**

### **1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE**

*This section is non-normative.*

This standard is relevant for the following audience:

- Catena-X certified Operational Companies acting as:
  - Business Application Provider
  - Data Provider and Consumer

This document focuses on the requirements regarding provision of fraud data and getting access to such data via reporting- / dashboard functionalities.

It is relevant for business application providers who want to provide services for collecting, aggregating and reporting fraud data by empowering the CX companies to provide such data in an easy but formalized, secure and anonymous way.

It is also relevant for data providers and consumers as it is initially the CX community who acts as data provider and consumer itself and can be extended with other communities or data providers.

### **1.2 CONTEXT**

*This section is non-normative.*

Fraud prevention service is a value-added service (VAS) in the area of Business Partner Data Management which addresses the challenges for a company in terms of legal, compliance- and finance-related requirements.

### **1.3 CONFORMANCE**

### **1.4 PROOF OF CONFORMITY**

*This section is non-normative.*

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).
