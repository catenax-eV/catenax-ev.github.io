# CX-0116 Sanction Party Watchlist Dashboard v1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

Doing business with companies (and affiliates) which are sanctioned or affected by embargos can result in fines and reputational damage. However, identification of sanctioned partners is difficult due to the vast amount of different sanction lists from several countries and authorities. Even manual checks are difficult due to a lack of high-quality data provisioned by the authorities. With Sanction and Watchlist Monitoring, data synchronized with a data mirror is monitored continuously against the latest sanction and watch lists. The Sanction Party Watchlist Dashboard (SWD) has to provide a summary on potential matches. The matching against sanction and watch lists have to be activated in the company data lookup, so data maintainers are already notified during creation or update workflows. The monitoring scope has to be extended to political exposed persons (so called PEPs). SWD has to visualize the outcome of the sanction watchlist monitoring rules via a dashboard.

SWD has to use the Gate API CX-0074\_v1.1.0 or higher for pulling BP data records. SWD has to be a client/ server cloud application which contains a Web Client and a Cloud Server Application.
SWD has to contain a user and authorization management capability aligned with the CX Portal and Marketplace user management. SWD has to contain an API and has to be  available in English and German language

## 3 SWD API

### 3.1 API ENDPOINTS AND RESOURCES

The resources MUST use the well-known HTTP request methods for CRU(D) operations:

- POST MUST be used for create requests  
- PUT MUST be used for update requests  
- GET MUST be used for read requests  

POST MAY also be used for read requests, if input is not given by parameters but rather by an HTTP body to bypass maximum URL length. PUT MAY also be used for upsert requests (create or update) if this is required. A state (active / inactive) at each entity MUST be used for a soft delete, so that the request method DELETE SHALL NOT be used. Other HTTP request methods SHALL NOT be used, including PATCH.

Downloading data from the SDW API MUST follow a staging concept with two stages, so that consumers of the SWD API can compare what they have downloaded from the Inbound Persistence via the Gate API into the input stage of SWD against what kind of SWD rule result and status code was provided for each business partner data record in the output stage. The following controllers MUST distinguish between an input and an output stage.

### 3.2 SANCTION PARTY WATCHLIST CONTROLLER

The Sanction Party Watchlist Controller MUST allow to read (search / return) sanction party watchlist incidents status codes related to an External Identifier or BPN ID in the input and output stage. It MUST have the following resources:

|Sanction Party Watchlist Controller Resources |Description |
| :-: | :-: |
|GET/api/swd/output/business partner data record with sanction party watchlist incident status codes|Returns business partner data record from the output stage with sanction party watchlist incident status information array|
|GET/api/swd/input/BP data records |Returns business partner data record by different search parameters from the input stage|
|GET/api/swd/output/business partner data record with sanction party workflow status|Returns workflow status by business partner data record in Filtered Business Partner List|
|GET/api/swd/output/shareholder natural person list by Business Partner data record|Returns first and last name of business partner data record shareholders|

### 3.3 SANCTION PARTY WATCHLIST SHARING STATE CONTROLLER

The sharing state controller MUST allow to read sharing state entries of BP data records complemented by the Sanction Party Watchlist incident status results.  The sharing state controller MUST have the following resources:

|Sharing State Resources |Description |
| :-: | :-: |
|GET/api/swd/sharing-state |Returns sharing states of business partner data record with incident status result  filtered by External Identifier, BPN ID and type, country, city and address|

### 3.4 EDC DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

For each read and write (create and update) resource in the SWD API input stage there MUST be a dedicated EDC data asset definition. For each read resource in the SWD API output stage there MUST be a dedicated EDC data asset definition. Write resources (create and update) of the SWD API output stage MUST not be called from outside of the Catena-X operating environment. Consequently, EDC data assets for them are NOT REQUIRED.
The SWD API MUST support the EDC functionality based on Sovereign Data Exchange, 2.0.1, CX - 0018 Eclipse Data Space Connector (EDC) or higher.

### 3.5 ERROR HANDLING

The following http response codes MUST be defined for all resources:  

- 200 – OK  
- 400 – Bad Request
- 401 – Unauthorized
- 403 – Forbidden
- 404 – Not Found  
- 500 – Internal Server Error

HTTP Status Code Registry MUST be adhered to in the implementation for the decision on when to use which error code: https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml
