# CX-0023 Notification API v1.2.2

## ABSTRACT

By leveraging network enabled traceability applications in conjunction with Catena-X as a network, the industry will be enabled to exchange and act upon quality issues in a more standardised, integrated, accelerated and precise manner. In order to achieve these goals, the traceability applications require standardized communication endpoints to exchange notifications, for example for quality issues or investigation requests. This document describes specific API endpoints and their integration into IDSA conform data assets, which each participating solution **MUST** implement in order to receive updates from other participants as notifications. When sending a notification the messages **MUST** be sent by calling the API behind the recipients IDSA conform data asset.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Notifications are - in contrast to classical data offers in Catena-X - a way to push data from a sender to a receiver. For now, these are limited to the sending and receiving of quality notifications as well as the update of the notification status (following a predefined status model).

This document describes the relevant API endpoints to be created by each traceability application and their integration into the IDSA Protocol and/or the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC).

This documentation covers exclusively the illustration of the specific API endpoints. The minimal process an application needs to support such notifications will not be handled here, but in a separate standard request [CX-0022].

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

For now, the notification API is limited to the sending and receiving of quality notifications as well as the update of the notification status (following a predefined status model).

This document describes the relevant API endpoints to be created by each traceability application and their integration into the IDSA Protocol and/or the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) as a reference implementation.

This standard covers exclusively the definition of the API endpoints. The minimal process an application needs to support for such notifications will not be handled here, but in a separate standard request [CX-0022].

Furthermore, this standard has not the scope and intention to be a general solution pattern for notifications across various use cases. For now, it is limited to the sending and receiving of quality notifications and investigations in a traceability context.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

The notification API is used as part of the notification process of traceability.

In this regard it is important to mention, that the API standardized here is not a central API to be called, but an API to be implemented into each participant's traceability solution or solution stack in order to be able to receive information related to quality issues and notifications in the first place.

### 1.3 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

> *This section is non-normative*

This document describes the Data Asset Structure within the participant who wants to be able to receive notifications and/or updates to notifications. As the notification process includes bi-directional status communication, both entities in a process **MUST** provide these Data Assets and a linkage to corresponding APIs.

On top the document describes the payload of the notifications for quality investigations and quality alerts.

### 1.4 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.5 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

All app providers* and their solutions will need to proof, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

In terms of conformity the openAPI specification of the application or endpoints being exposed via the EDC or any similar IDS conformant connector **MUST** be checked against the standardized openAPI specification.

Examples of data assets and contract offer structure in the EDC or any other IDS protocol compliant connector **MUST** correspond to the described structure.

**Disclaimer: The operating model released by the Catena-X association will define the roadmap, content and scope for the certification process. This will include the roles, certification and further assessment procedures as well as the rollout phases.*

### 1.6 EXAMPLES

#### Example 1: Quality Investigation

I discover a quality issue during assembly with several parts of a specific supplier. I want to inform him to perform a quality investigation on his side and want to communicate this data securely and sovereign to my supplier.

#### Example 2: Quality Alert

I discover a problem with specific batches or serialized parts on my end affecting also parts already shipped and want to communicate this data securely and sovereign to my customers.

## 2 Quality Notification API

> *This section is normative*

### 2.1 Preconditions and dependencies

Application providers **MUST** proof their conformity by providing:

- An openAPI specification of the endpoints described.

- Examples of the data asset and contract definition structure in their EDC or any other IDS protocol compliant connector.

The notification API **MUST** be published towards the network using a Data Asset/Contract Definition in terms of the IDSA Protocol as described by the reference implementation [CX - 0018 Eclipse Data Space Connector (EDC)].

The Eclipse Dataspace Connector as a reference implementation **SHOULD** BE used and is referenced in this document. Other connectors fulfilling the same standards towards Catena-X **MAY** be leveraged as well.

It is of importance to mention, that there **MUST** be an API available behind each of the data offers described in the EDC, which works according to the openAPI specifications description.

Nevertheless, the APIs are **OPTIONAL** to follow the same structure, as there could even be APIs taking over the job of several of the endpoints mentioned.

The EDC **SHOULD** act as a reverse proxy towards those APIs, as it holds the Data Offers linked to the respective implemented endpoints.

### 2.2 API Specification

#### 2.2.1 API-Endpoints

The notification API **MUST** be implemented as specified in the openAPI documentation as stated here: [openAPI](./assets/quality-notification-cx-release-3.1-PI8-openapi.yaml)

The notification API **MUST** implement four endpoints similar to:

- POST /qualityinvestigations/receive
- POST /qualityinvestigations /update
- POST /qualityalert /receive
- POST /qualityalert/update

In addition, the notification API **MAY** implement two endpoints similar to:

- POST /qualityinvestigations /resolve
- POST /qualityalert/resolve

In fact, it is **OPTIONAL** to implement the endpoint paths exactly as described above. The reason is that those endpoints are not called from any supply chain partner directly. Rather, they are called from the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) as part of EDC data assets. In that sense, it is just important to implement endpoints that can process the defined request body and respond with the HTTP status codes and - if required - reply with the defined response body.

The EDCs data assets will act similar to a reverse proxy for the notification endpoints, therefore rather the EDC data assets are of significance, which **SHOULD** be exposed towards Catena-X through the Data

Offer Catalogues in the EDC or any other IDSA Protocol compatible connector.

#### 2.2.2 Available Data Types

The notification API **MUST** use JSON as the payload transported via HTTP.

#### 2.2.3 API resources & endpoints

The HTTP POST endpoints introduced in this standard **MUST** be called via Data Space Protocol.

The sending and receiving of notifications **MUST** be built on the basis of HTTP POST endpoints.

### 2.3 EDC Data Asset Structure

#### 2.3.1 EDC Data Asset for Notification Receive Endpoint for Quality Investigation Receipt

When using the EDC, the following asset **MUST** be registered. Other connectors implementing the IDSA Protocol require a similar data asset with the same structure and provisioning towards Catena-X.

```json

"proxyPath": "true",
"type": "HttpData"
}
}

```

The variable \{httpServerWhichOffersTheHttpEndpoint\} **MUST** be set to the HTTP server that offers the endpoint. The path /qualityinvestigations/update **MAY** align with the HTTP POST path as stated in Section 2.2.1. In that sense it can change dependent on the traceability application.

#### 2.3.4 EDC Data Asset for Notification Update Endpoint for Quality Alert Update

When using the EDC the following asset **MUST** be registered. Other connectors implementing the IDSA Protocol require a similar data asset with the same structure and provisioning towards Catena-X.
