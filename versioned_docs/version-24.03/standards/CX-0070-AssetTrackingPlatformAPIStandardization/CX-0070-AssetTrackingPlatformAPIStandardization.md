# CX-0070 Asset Tracking Platform API Standardization 1.0.0

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

Please refer to AUDIENCE & SCOPE.

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

This is the initial version of the standard.

## ABSTRACT

The asset tracking use case aims to design a standard solution how diverse IoT solutions, available on the free market, can be incorporated into the Catena-X network keeping the interoperability and data sovereignty requirements respected. Although the main goal was always to track company assets with the various IoT devices, based on the set of standards designed by asset tracking use case team, there is a potential to fully use these in any use case in the Catena-X environment and beyond. The model opens the door for any IoT device manufacturer and any network provider to be part of the Catena-X network.

The Asset Tracking Platform aims to bring different IoT sensor networks to a standard Catena-X network and use sensor data for a variety of use cases, like:

- logistics teams can track their returnable packages and assets at any time using geo data,
- usage of automatic filling level measurements to drive efficient vendor-managed inventories,
- users (tier suppliers, customer, carriers, insurers, etc.) are encouraged to monitor the quality of critical materials at any time during transportation.
  
The solution supports the exchange of IoT sensor data between different companies via Catena-X network.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

This documentation describes the basic pre-conditions and needs for an ATP-API that aims to provide data from multiple IoT networks to the Catena-X ecosystem.

ATP-API receives data from IoT networks, transforms these data to standardized Catena-X data models (IoT Sensor Data Device and IoT Sensor Data) and load the transformed data into the Catena-X network.

The primary role of the ATP is to be a middleware solution between those IoT networks and the Catena-X ecosystem by using REST API technology.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This document is meant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

The ATP is a solution for organizations to provide IoT sensor and device data in the Catena-X network. It supports also the onboarding process of an IoT Sensor Device for the registration in Catena-X network so that this feature can easily integrated into any application.

This document describes the relevant API endpoints to be created by each application and their integration into the Eclipse Dataspace connector (EDC). This standard covers exclusively the definition of the specific API endpoint. The minimal process an application needs to support for such notifications will not be handled here.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

As described earlier, the ATP can be used as a middleware solution between IoT networks and the Catena-X ecosystem.

Therefor the solution relies on HTTP communication with multiple instances of IoT networks which they themselves offer any sort of HTTP API for communication.

It is assumed that all sensor data are provided in a decoded structure and that the networks actively push their data to a certain HTTP endpoint after the onboarding in Catena-X network.

It is also assumed that the IoT network allows basic management of sensor devices via their own API.

Any assumptions made might differ from a real-world or use case, therefore the API shall be structured in a modular way and allow adjustments.

As stated before, the ATP shall be a middleware solution between IoT networks and the Catena-X ecosystem.

It is positioned like in the example below.

![atp-middleware.png](./assets/atp-middleware.png)

Its basic architectural design is described in the following diagram.

![atp-global-architecture](./assets/atp-global-architecture.png)

IoT Network
: This block is a reference for an IoT network which is connected to the ATP. There may be multiple networks that are
attached to the ATP via its API.

Application/Dashboard
: This references a data consumer/user of the ATP API. Notice that the application can communicate with the API when
requesting device information data directly from the IoT network and the Iot Sensor data via the EDC.

DataConverter
: Components of the API that translate data from the IoT network to the standardized data models before providing them to the Catena-X ecosystem.

Device Registry
: Persistence Module/Database that stores Meta-Data for an IoT Sensor Device. The persisted information contains device
identifiers in its network, identifiers used in the Catena-X ecosystem and information regarding the device owner.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams,
examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in
this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**,
**REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to proof, that they conform
with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied
correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

#### 1.3.1 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is normative*

To proof conformity with the use case Asset Tracking, the API

- **MUST** be able to translate data from an IoT network to the standardized data models IotSensorDeviceDefinition and IotSensorData
- **MUST** provide the translated/standardized data to the Catena-X ecosystem
- **MUST** store the standardized data at a decentral submodel server (AAS) which is accessible via an EDC
- **MUST** provide data assets, policies and contracts within an EDC to make the standardized data accessible in the Catena-X ecosystem
- **MUST** register Digital Twins/AAS/Shell-Descriptors in a decentralized DTR to make the data discoverable in the Catena-X ecosystem (refer to 2.2 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS)
- **MUST** provide access to the IoT networks and their respective APIs

### 1.4 EXAMPLES

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

the association homepage.

## 2 "ASSET TRACKING PLATFORM" API

> *This section is normative*

The ATP API is logically structured in five groups:

- API Management / Administration
- Device Management
- Network Administration
- Handling IoT Data
- Catena-X

Each group is protected and thus can only be accessed by providing a valid API Key.

API Management allows you to manage the ATP API. With the basic implementation it comes with creating and deleting API Keys that allows users to access the APIs resources. These endpoints are explicitly protected and only allow access if the requesting entity has the role of an administrator. When initially creating an ATP instance with a database, the
admin key must be provided via the config-file. Newly added keys will, by default, only have the "USER"-role and can therefore not create or delete any new API keys.

The device management resources allows the management of IoT devices in their network. For example, if a user wants to
request a device information which it has in its network, the data can be requested via these endpoints.

Network administration resources provide access to specific management functions provided by the network.

IoT data is handled by sending the data object to a specific API endpoint. By doing so, the data will be handled
depending on the network it was sent from. It is then normalized and provided to the Catena-X network.

Catena-X resources allow the interaction with digital twins. If an IoT device and its data shall be introduced to the
Catena-X network, the user may request the creation of a digital twin via this resource.

## 2.1 PRECONDITIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

In order to persist the necessary data, a persistence module, specifically a database, is REQUIRED by the ATP. In there,
the ATP stores the API Keys and Device Registry Entries that help with associating a devices network and Catena-X
information.

Communication with an IoT network is established via HTTP requests. By doing so, users can request non-standardized data from the respective network.

All standardized data, including the digital representation of an IoT device (Digital Twins, Shell Descriptors) and its data, is provided as a submodel via a decentral AAS. This data is accessible via an EDC. Therefore, when providing and exchanging data to the Catena-X network, an EDC is REQUIRED. The same is applicable for consuming the data, as access to the provided data is also granted via an EDC. Therefore, when consuming data from the ATP, an EDC is also REQUIRED.

To make the data discoverable in the Catena-X network, a Shell Descriptor MUST be created. Therefore, a decentralized DTR instance is REQUIRED.

#### 2.2.1.3 Sending and Retrieving Data

**GET PAIRED STATUS OF AN IOT DEVICE**

**GET** ``https://{baseURL}/{apiVersion}/paired-status/{network}/{deviceId}``

**Description**

Get the current active/paired status of a device.

Response is determined by the status in the device registry and the network.

If the device is active AND paired in both instances, it is paired and transmitting data.

If the device is either not active in the network or not paired in the Device Registry Entry (or both), no data will be appended to the AAS as a Submodel.
