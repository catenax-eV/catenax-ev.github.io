# CX-0106 Aspect Model IotSensorData v1.0.0

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

Please refer to AUDIENCE & SCOPE.

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

This is the initial version of the standard.

## ABSTRACT

The asset tracking use case aims to design a standard solution how diverse IoT solutions, available on the free market, can be incorporated into the Catena-X network keeping the interoperability and data souvereignty requirements respected. Although the main goal was always to track company assets with the various IoT devices, based on the set of standards designed by asset tracking use case team, there is a potential to fully use these in any use case in the Catena-X environment and beyond. The model opens the door for any IoT device manufacturer and any network provider to be part of the Catena-X network.

The data model “IotSensorData” represents a set of data collected from IoT sensor devices. The definition of IoT Sensor Devices is provided in a separate data model “IotSensorDeviceDefinition”. The sensor values have a normalized format independently from the origin network. The sensor data is the output of a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment (temperature, light, humidity, movement, etc.). The output may be used to provide input information to another system (e.g. an application to track assests) or to guide a process (e.g. support root cause analysis for quality issues with the tracked assets).

## 1 INTRODUCTION

This document describes a semantic model to support the exchange of IoT sensor data between different companies via Catena-X network. The Asset Tracking Platform receives data from IoT networks, and transforms it to this semantic model.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

The standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

The data model “IotSensorData” represents a set of data collected from IoT sensor devices. The sensor data is the output of a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment  (temperature, light, humidity, movement, etc.). The output may be used to provide input information to another system (e.g. an application to track assests) or to guide a process (e.g. support root cause analysis for quality issues with the tracked assets).

The model counts with various transmission methods how data can be collected from sensors, e.g. LPWAN, WiFi, Cellular/Satellite, Bluetooth, Zigbee, W-Wave,etc.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The purpose of the Asset Tracking product is to track individual assets with various IoT sensor devices. The data model “IotSensorData” represents a set of data collected from IoT sensor devices. The sensor values are interpretable only in relation to the assets which they are attached to.

The challenge is to cover various network solutions used by sensors to provide data, like LPWAN, WiFi, Cellular/Satellite, Bluetooth, Zigbee, W-Wave, etc.

One of the important sensor values represent the GPS coordinates, which allows to locate assets in real time. The traceability of assets allows to improve business planning processes, e.g. geographical location of a returnable container allows production planners to better estimate arrival time of raw materials.

Beside of the geographical location another sensor values, like humidity, light conditions, filling level, acceleration, etc. are playing key role to improve supply chain processes. Sensor value-based documentation of the asset lifecycle supports complaint management, e.g. proven shock can impact the functionality or quality of an asset; extreme weather conditions during transportation can damage material quality in returnable containers, what should be reflected in the product shelf-life, etc.

The huge volume of data produced and transmitted from sensor devices provides a lot of information that is often critical to enterprise decision-making.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams,
examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in
this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**,
**REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions **MUST** proof, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).  

The proof of conformity for a single semantic model is done according to the general rules for proving the conformity of data provided to a semantic model or the ability to consume the corresponding data.
