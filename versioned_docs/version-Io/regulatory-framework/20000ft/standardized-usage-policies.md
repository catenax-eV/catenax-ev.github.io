# Standardized Usage Policies

The standardized usage policies represent a consolidation of the predefined use case frameworks. The only difference is the purpose of use.

The Catena-X ODRL profile is used for this purpose. The primary aim of the Catena-X ODRL profile is to provide standardised contract modules such as permissions, prohibitions and obligations in a machine-readable format that can be checked automatically. The ODRL profile enables the automation of contract negotiations in the Catena-X data space, as contract negotiations are conducted electronically as standard via a registered connector.

All standardised contract modules referenced in the Catena-X ODRL profile have a legal description, a technical term for referencing (‘leftOperand’) and in some cases a defined list of possible or permitted or standardised values (‘rightOperand’). The Catena-X ODRL profile initially focuses on providing standardised data usage guidelines (‘purposes’) for the Catena-X use cases as a common basis that all participants in the data space can rely on to ensure trust, interoperability and scalability. These guidelines represent the Catena-X value proposition of data sovereignty in its purest form.
