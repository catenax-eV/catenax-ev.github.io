| Relationship     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| IAM-Sync         | The IdP is a service responsible for storing and verifying user   identities. Its objective is to enable user access to all IAMs of Catena-X   operators as soon as they onboard themselves and receive a user in an IAM.   Achieving this requires synchronization of each IAM with every other one, a   process known as Identity-Sync, which involves both regular users and   technical clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Integration      | Technical integration is required to use Core Services Section B of the   CSP-B. The other parties must have access to the services to be able to offer   their services. The technical integration refers to an API. This includes   documentation, access data, definition of commercial aspects and SLAs. To   fully utilize Core Services B of the CSP-B, it is required to perform   technical integration with the related APIs. This integration is necessary   for enabling other data space participants to access the services to provide   their own services. This also includes to provide documentation, access   credentials, and define commercial aspects and SLAs for other related   services to ensure smooth functionality. |
| Onboarding       | The onboarding enables either existing customers in other networks or   interested parties to access the Catena-X data space (Trusted Access Point).   This is the technical connection and registration of the participants. With   the successful completion of the onboarding, the participant is part of   Catena-X and can use the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Certification    | When certified by a CAB, the party is audited against the Catena-X   standards. These independent third parties ensure security and   in-teroperability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Nomination       | The nomination process is designed to ensure neutrality and trustworthy   execution of selected roles and tasks within the Catena-X ecosystem. The   various rights and obligations of the operator are described in the Request   for Tender (RFT).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Qualification    | With the qualification, the Catena-X Association ensures that there is a   uniform level of quality and service of the various providers. This creates   security and trust for the users of the services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Trademark Rights | With the different qualifications and certifications, the respective   parties receive different Catena-X labels. With these they can identify   themselves and use them for illustration. The Catena-X Association holds the   trademark rights to the labels and Catena-X itself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Use              | Within Catena-X, a participant can use different offers from service   providers (AP, ESP, BAP). These are certified applications. Alternatively,   they can certify and operate them by themselves, but then it would not use   services. The offers can be SaaS solutions or local deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
