title: Roadmap Planning
---

The roadmap represents all initiatives within the association aimed at making significant progress in the data space. It serves as a guide for association bodies to align their efforts and informs users about the expected delivery of high-impact features. Therefore, careful planning and accurate estimations of target release dates are essential for effective roadmap management.

The planning of roadmap items is not triggered by a specific event but is an ongoing effort involving committees, expert groups, and all association members, working together toward their shared goal of advancing the data space.

To ensure a structured and goal-oriented approach, all planning items within the association must be linked directly or indirectly to a roadmap item. This alignment ensures that every effort contributes to the broader strategic objectives of the association.

## Create Roadmap Item

Roadmap must be added to the <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->[Release Roadmap Board](https://github.com/orgs/catenax-eV/projects/28/views/19)<!-- markdown-link-check-enable --> using the Roadmap Item template provided in Github. The new Roadmap Item should contain as many informations as possible but must contain at least:

- a meaningfull title,
- a description outlining the scope of it so that other association members can understand it,
- a Committee as driver, who is responsible to oversee the implementation of the Roadmap Item (the driver should only be set in alignment with the respective committee!),
- an overview of Expert Groups that might have to contribute to the implementation of the Roadmap Item (set the Expert Group as a label to the Roadmap Item). The list will be reviewed during the Roadmap Review Meeting, and
- a Target Release (as Milestone) when the Roadmap Item should be delivered.

All other informations requested by the Roadmap Item template must be added before presenting it in the Roadmap Review Meeting!

Specific access to GitHub needed, which is managed by the C-X Management Office. Only Catena-X e.V. members are allowed to get access!

## Roadmap Review Meeting

All roadmap items must be presented at least once during the C-X Roadmap Review Meeting. While this does not necessarily have to happen in the meeting immediately preceding the start of work, it should take place as soon as the scope is clearly defined.

The purpose of the meeting is to introduce initial ideas for potential roadmap items in upcoming releases. It provides an open forum where participants can present their concepts, allowing association members to gain early insights, identify key stakeholders, and gather feedback from the broader community. The responsible Committee or Expert Group presents the roadmap items to initiate discussions among association members. The expected outcome is a clear understanding of the scope and the identification of any further alignment needs for the refinement phase.

:::warning[TIP]
First announcement of intended activities for the upcoming release.  
**Principle:** Let all the Association know what is coming next and gather feedback.
