| **Name** | **Category** | **Description** |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Standard Phase** | Phase | The standard phase comprises the **development** of the **standards**.|
| **Deadline standard request**| Milestone | **Deadline** for the **submission** of standardization or **change requests** through GitHub. <br /> [Link to Change Requests](https://github.com/catenax-eV/product-standardization-prod/issues) |
| **Quality Gate 1** | Phase| A first quality gate (“quality gate I”) **ensures** that standard candidates moving forward are **limited to those that adhere to the values and goals of the Catena-X data ecosystem**. Each standard candidate is checked for relevance, redundancy, and conformance. Provided a green light has been given, the standard candidate is officially transferred into the release schedule. The quality gate criteria are depicted in the annex. |
| **Main Creation Phase** | Phase | In this stage, the actual **standard** is **being created in its draft form**. The moment, a standardization request has been approved, a corresponding standard template is being created and provided to the requesters. They are provided a time window in which the template must be filled out before submitting the draft standard candidate into the verification phase during the current release cycle. |
| **Deadline for delivering standard candidate**| Milestone | **Strict deadline** for **delivering standard** documents |
| **Standards - Deadline for submitting data models** | Milestone | The deadline describes when the data model must be ready for publication in the standard; a complete pr must exist by that date.|
| **Quality Gate 2** | Phase | A second quality gate (“quality gate II”) thus **ensures** that only standard candidates that correspond to the quality expectations of Catena-X are being released. During quality gate II, the **maturity of the standard is being verified** and, provided a green light is given, a technical recommendation for its release is made to the Executive Board. The quality gate criteria are depicted in the annex. |
| **Start Opt-Out for standard candidates** | Milestone | Beginning of the  Opt-Out phase. |
| **Opt-Out** | Phase | After a formal approval, an opt-out period of **45 days** is required, during which all association members have to be presented with the standard candidates ahead of their official release to the public. After the 45-day opt-out period has passed, the Executive Board is presented the standard candidates again for a final approval for publication, marking their official transition from being a standard candidate into an official Catena-X standard. |
| **End Opt-Out** | Milestone |End of the Opt-Out Phase |
| **FOSS Phase** | Phase | The FOSS phase comprises the **development of the software** in the context of Tractus-X. These components are implemented by dedicated product teams, each responsible for specific functional units. Once development is complete, the phase concludes with a final integration and a comprehensive end-to-end testing process to ensure interoperability and system readiness.|
