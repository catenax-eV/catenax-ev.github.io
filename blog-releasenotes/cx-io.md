### Further Scope Clarification

To uphold the integrity and reliability of the onboarding process, there will be a temporary change of the standards. This change is in-line with a feature supported in the current reference implementation.

Impact: [CSP-B](/docs/operating-model/who-roles-in-the-catena-x-ecosystem#core-service-provider-b) & [OSP](/docs/operating-model/who-roles-in-the-catena-x-ecosystem#onboarding-service-provider) roles:

- [CX-0006](/docs/standards/CX-0006-RegistrationAndInitialOnboarding#238-gaia-x).
  - The standard has been slightly adjusted. Onboarding service providers and core service providers must continue to support the possibility of creating a Self-Description (SD) of the Legal Person. However, this requirement is no longer strictly tied to the initial registration process; the creation of the SD can now occur at a later stage. For any SDs that are issued, they must be stored in a central location and must comply with GAIA-X standards and guidelines.

The functionality of Catena-X and the security framework will remain unaffected furthermore the validation of company data and identifiers will continue as usual.
