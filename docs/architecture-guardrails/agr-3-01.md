## Why

The [Tractus-X Ontology](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-ontology-model) provides a shared conceptual framework and vocabulary for the Catena-X ecosystem. It defines the meaning of domain concepts, their relationships, and how they connect to data models.

A well-governed ontology ensures:

- **Semantic Interoperability**: Common understanding across organizations
- **Data Quality**: Consistent interpretation of business concepts
- **Evolution**: Controlled growth of the conceptual model
- **Alignment**: Harmonization with industry standards

Without proper ontology governance:
- Concepts become ambiguous or contradictory
- Integration between use cases becomes difficult
- Data quality degrades
- Technical debt accumulates in the semantic layer

This guardrail defines **when** and **how** the Catena-X ontology must be modified to maintain a coherent, high-quality conceptual model.

## Description

This guardrail specifies the process for proposing, reviewing, and implementing changes to the Tractus-X ontology, ensuring that the ontology remains consistent, accurate, and aligned with ecosystem needs.

### Key Requirements

:::danger MUST
Any change to the ontology **must**:
- Be proposed through a GitHub issue in the sldt-ontology-model repository
- Include clear business justification and use case alignment
- Be reviewed by the ontology working group
- Maintain consistency with existing ontology structure
- Be documented with clear definitions and examples
- Follow OWL (Web Ontology Language) best practices
- Include impact analysis on existing models and standards
:::

:::warning SHOULD  
Ontology changes **should**:
- Align with domain-specific and cross-industry ontologies (e.g., BAMM, schema.org)
- Reuse existing concepts before creating new ones
- Follow established naming conventions
- Include multilingual labels and descriptions where applicable
- Provide rationale for design decisions
:::

## Scope

### In Scope
- Adding new classes and properties to the ontology
- Modifying existing class and property definitions
- Defining new relationships between concepts
- Deprecating outdated concepts
- Ontology versioning and releases

### Out of Scope
- Aspect model changes (see [AGR-2.01](./agr-2-01.md))
- API specifications
- Implementation-specific technical models

## When to Change the Ontology

### Add New Concepts When:

1. **New Domain Requirements**
   - A new use case introduces business concepts not in the ontology
   - Cross-use-case concepts emerge that need formal definition
   - Industry-standard concepts need to be incorporated

2. **Semantic Gaps**
   - Existing aspect models reference concepts not defined in the ontology
   - Ambiguity exists in how concepts are interpreted
   - Relationships between concepts are unclear

3. **Standardization Needs**
   - External standards (e.g., ISO, IEC) introduce relevant concepts
   - Alignment with other automotive or industry ontologies is needed

:::tip Best Practice
Before adding new concepts, thoroughly review existing ontology and related ontologies (BFO, schema.org, automotive ontologies) to maximize reuse.
:::

### Modify Existing Concepts When:

1. **Clarification Needed**
   - Definitions are ambiguous or incomplete
   - Multiple interpretations exist
   - Examples need improvement

2. **Relationship Refinement**
   - New relationships between concepts are discovered
   - Hierarchies need restructuring
   - Constraints need adjustment

3. **Alignment Required**
   - External standards have changed
   - Cross-industry alignment opportunities exist
   - Inconsistencies with aspect models are identified

:::warning Caution
Modifications to existing concepts can have wide-ranging impacts. Always perform thorough impact analysis.
:::

### Deprecate Concepts When:

1. **Obsolescence**
   - Concepts are no longer used in any active use case
   - Better alternatives exist
   - Industry standards have superseded the concept

2. **Consolidation**
   - Multiple concepts represent the same thing
   - Simplification improves clarity

:::danger Breaking Changes
Deprecation must follow a phased approach with adequate notice and migration path.
:::

## Implementation Guidelines

### Step 1: Proposal Submission

Create a GitHub issue in the sldt-ontology-model repository:

```markdown
## Ontology Change Proposal

**Change Type**: [New Concept / Modification / Deprecation]

**Concept Name**: [Name of class/property]

**Business Justification**:
[Explain the business need and use case alignment]

**Use Cases**:
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]

**Proposed Definition**:
[Clear, concise definition of the concept]

**Related Concepts**:
- [Existing ontology concepts this relates to]
- [External ontologies or standards]

**Impact Analysis**:
- Affected aspect models: [List]
- Affected standards: [List]
- Breaking changes: [Yes/No - details]

**Alternatives Considered**:
[What existing concepts were evaluated and why they don't fit]

**Examples**:
[Concrete examples showing how the concept is used]
```

### Step 2: Ontology Development

Develop the ontology extension using OWL (Web Ontology Language):

```turtle
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix cx: <https://ontology.catenax.net/core#> .
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .

# Define a new class
cx:Vehicle a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Vehicle"@en ;
    rdfs:label "Fahrzeug"@de ;
    rdfs:comment "A motorized means of transportation designed primarily for use on roads."@en ;
    skos:definition "A machine, usually with wheels and an engine, used for transporting people or goods on land, especially on roads."@en ;
    skos:example "Examples include cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses."@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf cx:Asset .

# Define a new property
cx:hasManufacturer a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "has manufacturer"@en ;
    rdfs:label "hat Hersteller"@de ;
    rdfs:comment "Relates a product to the organization that manufactured it."@en ;
    rdfs:domain cx:Product ;
    rdfs:range cx:Organization .

# Define a datatype property
cx:productionYear a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:label "production year"@en ;
    rdfs:label "Produktionsjahr"@de ;
    rdfs:comment "The year in which an item was produced."@en ;
    rdfs:domain cx:Product ;
    rdfs:range xsd:gYear .
```

### Step 3: Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation:

**Concept Documentation Template**:
```markdown
## [Concept Name]

### Definition
[Clear, formal definition]

### Purpose
[Why this concept exists in the ontology]

### Properties
- **Domain**: [What this concept applies to]
- **Range**: [What values/types it can have]
- **Constraints**: [Any restrictions or rules]

### Relationships
- **Parent Concepts**: [Superclasses]
- **Related Concepts**: [Associated concepts]
- **Used In**: [Aspect models that use this]

### Examples
[Real-world examples demonstrating the concept]

### Notes
[Additional context, design decisions, rationale]

### External Alignments
- [Link to corresponding concepts in other ontologies/standards]
```

### Step 4: Validation

Validate the ontology using OWL reasoners and validation tools:

```bash
# Validate OWL syntax and consistency
robot validate --input ontology.owl

# Check for logical consistency
robot reason --input ontology.owl \
             --reasoner ELK \
             --output ontology-inferred.owl

# Generate documentation
robot extract --input ontology.owl \
              --method subset \
              --output ontology-module.owl
```

### Step 5: Review Process

The ontology change undergoes multi-level review:

1. **Technical Review** (Ontology experts)
   - OWL syntax and structure
   - Consistency with ontology principles
   - Alignment with best practices

2. **Domain Review** (Subject matter experts)
   - Business correctness
   - Completeness of definition
   - Alignment with industry understanding

3. **Impact Review** (Data modeling and standards teams)
   - Effect on aspect models
   - Effect on standards
   - Migration requirements

4. **Architecture Review** (Architecture board)
   - Strategic alignment
   - Long-term maintainability
   - Cross-use-case implications

### Step 6: Integration and Release

Once approved:
- Merge to main branch
- Version and tag the release
- Update related documentation
- Communicate to ecosystem participants
- Update dependent aspect models and standards

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Class

:::tip Best Practice
Well-defined class with clear hierarchy and documentation.
:::

```turtle
cx:ElectricVehicle a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Electric Vehicle"@en ;
    rdfs:label "Elektrofahrzeug"@de ;
    rdfs:comment "A vehicle that is powered by one or more electric motors, using energy stored in rechargeable batteries."@en ;
    skos:definition "A road vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion, drawing electrical energy from a battery or other energy storage device."@en ;
    skos:example "Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, BMW i3"@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf cx:Vehicle ;
    rdfs:subClassOf [
        a owl:Restriction ;
        owl:onProperty cx:hasPowerSource ;
        owl:someValuesFrom cx:ElectricPowerSource
    ] .
```

**Why this is good**:
- Clear multilingual labels
- Comprehensive definition
- Concrete examples
- Proper class hierarchy
- Formal restrictions defining the concept

### Example 2: Defining Relationships

:::tip Best Practice
Object property with domain and range constraints.
:::

```turtle
cx:consistsOf a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "consists of"@en ;
    rdfs:label "besteht aus"@de ;
    rdfs:comment "Relates a composite object to its component parts."@en ;
    rdfs:domain cx:CompositeProduct ;
    rdfs:range cx:Component ;
    owl:inverseOf cx:isPartOf ;
    a owl:TransitiveProperty .
```

**Why this is good**:
- Defines domain and range
- Specifies inverse relationship
- Declares transitivity (important for reasoning)
- Multilingual support

### Example 3: Anti-Pattern - Vague Definition

:::danger What Not To Do
Poorly defined concept without clear semantics.
:::

```turtle
cx:Thing a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Thing"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Some kind of thing"@en .

cx:relatedTo a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "related to"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Is related to something"@en .
```

**Why this is wrong**:
- Overly vague and generic
- No clear business meaning
- No domain/range constraints
- No examples or use cases
- Doesn't add semantic value

## FAQ

### Question 1: What's the difference between the ontology and aspect models?

**Ontology**: Conceptual model defining domain concepts, their meanings, and relationships. It's technology-independent and represents shared understanding.

**Aspect Models**: Technical data models defining the structure of runtime data for specific APIs and exchanges. They implement and reference ontology concepts.

Think of it as: Ontology = "What things mean", Aspect Models = "How data is structured".

### Question 2: How often should the ontology be updated?

The ontology should evolve incrementally as new concepts emerge from use cases. Typical update frequency:
- **Minor updates**: Monthly to quarterly (new concepts, clarifications)
- **Major releases**: Annually (significant restructuring, breaking changes)

### Question 3: Can I reference external ontologies?

Yes! Reusing concepts from established ontologies (schema.org, BFO, automotive ontologies) is encouraged. Use `owl:equivalentClass` and `owl:equivalentProperty` to align concepts:

```turtle
cx:Vehicle owl:equivalentClass schema:Vehicle .
```

### Question 4: What tools should I use for ontology development?

Recommended tools:
- **Protégé**: Visual ontology editor
- **ROBOT**: Command-line ontology tool
- **ELK/HermiT**: Reasoners for validation
- **WebVOWL**: Visualization tool

### Question 5: How do I deprecate an ontology concept?

Use OWL deprecation annotations and provide migration guidance:

```turtle
cx:OldConcept a owl:Class ;
    owl:deprecated true ;
    rdfs:comment "DEPRECATED: Use cx:NewConcept instead. This concept will be removed in version 3.0.0."@en ;
    rdfs:seeAlso cx:NewConcept .
```
