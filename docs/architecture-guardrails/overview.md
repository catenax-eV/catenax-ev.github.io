# Architecture Guardrails

## Introduction

The Catena-X Architecture Guardrails (AGR) define a set of rules and best practices to ensure consistency, quality, and compliance across the Catena-X ecosystem. Similar to the Tractus-X Release Guidelines (TRGs), these guardrails provide clear, actionable guidance for architects, developers, and standardization teams.

:::info Purpose
Architecture Guardrails help maintain high standards across the Catena-X ecosystem by providing clear rules for:
- Conformity assessment criteria
- Data model management
- Ontology evolution
- Standard documentation
- Architecture decisions
:::

## Structure

Each Architecture Guardrail follows a consistent structure:

- **Title**: Clear identification of the guardrail (e.g., AGR-1)
- **Status**: Current state (Draft, Active, Deprecated)
- **Why**: Rationale and business context
- **Description**: Detailed requirements and guidelines
- **Examples**: Practical implementation examples
- **References**: Related standards and documentation

## Guardrail Categories

The guardrails are organized into the following categories:

### AGR-1: Standards and Conformity
Guidelines for creating, maintaining, and assessing standards and conformity criteria.

### AGR-2: Data Modeling
Rules for managing semantic models, aspect models, and data structures.

### AGR-3: Ontology Management
Governance for ontology changes and extensions.

### AGR-4: Documentation
Best practices for creating clear, comprehensive documentation.

## How to Use

:::tip Getting Started
1. Identify the relevant guardrail category for your task
2. Read the specific guardrail requirements
3. Follow the examples and templates provided
4. Consult related standards and documentation
5. Ensure compliance before submitting your work
:::

## Compliance

All contributions to the Catena-X ecosystem **must** comply with applicable Architecture Guardrails. Non-compliance may result in:

- Rejection during review processes
- Required rework before acceptance
- Delayed certification or approval

:::warning Important
Regular reviews ensure guardrails remain current and relevant. Feedback and improvement suggestions are welcome through the standard contribution process.
