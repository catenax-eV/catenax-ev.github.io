# CX-0066 Aspect Model: End of Life of Vehicle Compliance v1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

The data model End of Life of Vehicle Compliance describes the RRR calculation results according to [ISO 22628](#31-normative-references). The values represent the calculated quotas, the material masses of each fraction, the mass of the vehicle or component, the considered recycling technologies, and the list of potential dismantled parts.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

This document describes one semantic model used in the Catena-X network

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

The standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider
- Enablement Service Provider

### 1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

The data model End of Life of Vehicle Compliance describes the RRR calculation results according to [ISO 22628](#31-normative-references). The values represent the calculated quotas, the material masses of each fraction, the mass of the vehicle or component, the considered recycling technologies and the list of potential dismantled parts.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams,
examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in
this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**,
**REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.4 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform
with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied
correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

- To proof conformity with the EndofLifeofVehicleCompliance Semantic Model Standard check your json file against the json schema.

- Every data provider of EndofLifeofVehicleCompliance data MUST provide the data conformant to the semantic model specified in this document.

- The unique identifier of the semantic model specified in this document MUST be used by the data provider to define the semantics of the data being transferred.

- Every certified business application relying on EndofLifeofVehicleCompliance data MUST be able to consume data conformant to the semantic model specified in this document.

- This semantic model MUST be made available in the central Semantic Hub.

The proof of conformity for a single semantic model is done according to the general rules for proving the conformity of data provided to a semantic model or the ability to consume the corresponding data.

Aspect Model
: a formal, machine-readable semantic description (expressed with RDF/turtle) of data accessible from an Aspect.

: Note 1 to entry: An Aspect Model must adhere to the Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM), i.e., it utilizes elements and relations defined in the Semantic Aspect Meta Model and is compliant to the validity rules defined by the Semantic Aspect Meta Model.  
  
: Note 2 to entry: Aspect model are logical data models which can be used to detail a conceptual model in order to describe the semantics of runtime data related to a concept. Further, elements of an Aspect model can/should refer to terms of a standardized Business Glossary (if existing).

## 2 ASPECT MODEL “ENDOFLIFEOFVEHICLECOMPLIANCE”

### 2.1 INTRODUCTION

The data model End of Life of Vehicle Compliance describes the RRR calculation results according to [ISO 22628](#31-normative-references). The values represent the calculated quotas, the material masses of each fraction, the mass of the vehicle or component, the considered recycling technologies and the list of potential dismantled parts

### 2.2 SPECIFICATION ARTIFACTS

The modeling of the semantic model specified in this document was done in accordance to the "semantic driven workflow" to create a submodel template specification [SMT](#32-non-normative-references).

This aspect model is written in SAMM 2.0.0 as a modeling language conformant to CX-0003
as input for the semantic deriven workflow.

Like all Catena-X data models, this model is available in a machine-readable format on GitHub
conformant to CX-0003.

### 2.3 LICENSE

This Catena-X data model is an outcome of Catena-X use case group R-Strategy Assistant.
This Catena-X data model is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution
4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0) license, which is available at Creative Commons4F4F.

### 2.4 IDENTIFER OF SEMANTIC MODEL

The semantic model has the unique identifier:

```text
        urn:bamm:io.catenax.end_of_life_of_vehicle_compliance:1.0.0
```

This identifier MUST be used by the data provider to define the semantics of the data being transferred.

### 2.5 FORMATS OF SEMANTIC MODEL

#### 2.5.1 RDF Turtle

The rdf turtle file, an instance of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, is the master for generating additional file formats and serializations.

```text
https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.material_for_homologation/1.0.0/MaterialForHomologation.ttl

```

Please note that the linked version contains the semantic model’s latest version at the time of publication of this standard. However, it is possible that minor functional adjustments (noticeable by increments of the middle number of the version number: 1.0.0) or bug fixes - downward compatible - (noticeable by increments of the last number of the version number: 1.0.X) have been added in the meantime. Such updated or adjusted versions are not explicitly linked, as they do not require a new standardization document and were not available at the time of the publication of this standard. Accordingly, it is recommended to look for the updated semantic model in eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models repository and to use the updated version instead, as it brings important bug fixes or even additional functionalities.

The open source command line tool of the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework  is used for generation
of other file formats like for example a JSON Schema, aasx for Asset Administration Shell Submodel
Template or a HTML documentation.

#### 2.5.2 JSON Schema

A JSON Schema can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The JSON Schema defines the Value-Only
payload of the Asset Administration Shell for the API operation "GetSubmodel".

#### 2.5.3 aasx

An AASX file can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The AASX file defines one of the requested
artifacts for a Submodel Template Specification conformant to [SMT](#32-non-normative-references).

Note: As soon as the specification V3.0 of the Asset Administration Shell specfication is available
an update will be provided.

### 2.6 SEMANTIC MODEL

The data model is described in SAMM . A html documentation can be generated from the rdf turtle file.
