# CX-0049 DID Document v2.2.0

## ABSTRACT

This standard defines requirements for the DID document of a Catena-X participant's wallet.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The DID document is a fundamental and mandatory concept in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).
It is a public document that contains the DID controller's public key, several service endpoints associated with the DID controller, and potentially other information.
Knowledge of a DID allows to resolve the DID and is therefore sufficient to get access to the corresponding DID document.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

#### AUDIENCE

This standard is relevant for the following roles (see [CX-0149](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0149-WalletRequirements) for more information about Catena-X-compliant wallets):

- Core Service Providers, in the context of provisioning wallets to participants
- participants, as they each must have a wallet associated with a compliant DID document

#### SCOPE

This standard defines the requirements a DID document must fulfil in order to be used by a participant in the Catena-X dataspace.
It does not define:

- wallet requirements (see [CX-0149](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0149-WalletRequirements))
- DIDs or DID methods (see [CX-0149](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0149-WalletRequirements))
- credential types (see [CX-0050](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0050-CXSpecificCredentials))

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

Every participant in the Catena-X dataspace is associated with and in control of their own Decentralized Identifier (DID).
Every DID has an associated DID document, which can be obtained simply by having knowledge of the DID.
DID documents are public documents!
While only the DID controller ("owner") may have write access, everyone has read access.
They contain information which the participant wants to make publicly available, such as their public key or service endpoints.
A participant's DID document is usually hosted by the participant's wallet, but may be hosted elsewhere.

### 1.3 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

> *This section is non-normative*

Not applicable.

### 1.4 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The keywords **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.5 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

Not applicable.
See [CX-0149], which requires Catena-X-compliant wallets be associated with a DID document compliant with this standard.

### 1.6 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

Not applicable.

## 2. MAIN CONTENT

The DID document of a Catena-X participant's wallet MUST be compliant with the [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/) specification.
Additionally, the DID document MUST be compliant with the for DID documents specified in the [Decentralized Claims Protocol (DCP) v1.0](https://eclipse-dataspace-dcp.github.io/decentralized-claims-protocol/v1.0-RC3/).
Especially, the required service of type "CredentialService" MUST be a Credential Service as defined in the [DCP v1.0 sec 5.2,](https://eclipse-dataspace-dcp.github.io/decentralized-claims-protocol/v1.0-RC3/#credential-service-endpoint-discovery) and it MUST be a Catena-X-compliant credential service/wallet as defined in [CX-0149](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0149-WalletRequirements).
Where the DID document contains a service of type "DataService", the corresponding "serviceEndpoint" MUST resolve to a Data Service as specified in the [Dataspace Protocol 2025-1-RC2](https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/2025-1-RC2/#discovery-of-service-endpoints).

### 2.1 DID DOCUMENT SCHEMA
