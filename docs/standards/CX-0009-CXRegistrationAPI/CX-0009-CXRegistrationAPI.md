## ABSTRACT

To become a participant of Catena-X, each applicant must go through a
registration process. Registration is a mandatory requirement for all
further activities within the Catena-X network. The registration
process, along with other services, provide the foundation of trust for
the Catena-X network.

The Registration & Administration Service describes the endpoints that are needed for
the registration process.

## 1. Introduction

To become a participant of Catena-X, each applicant must go through a
registration process. Registration is a mandatory requirement for all
further activities within the Catena-X network. The registration
process, along with other services, provide the foundation of trust for
the Catena-X network.

### 1.1 Audience & Scope

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Core Service Provider
- Onboarding Service Provider (for reference)

### 1.2 Context

> *This section is non-normative*

The registration API is used as part of the registration process.

### 1.3 Architecture Overview

> *This section is non-normative*

A core service provider operates among other things a registration
frontend through which a registering company can enter its data. In the
future, the registration service may be accessed remotely, for example
by onboarding service provider, so the API needs to be standardized.

### 1.4 Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines,
diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED,
SHOULD and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted as
described in [BCP
14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14) \[[RFC2119](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-rfc2119)\]
\[[RFC8174](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-rfc8174)\] when, and
only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.5 Proof of conformity

> *This section is non-normative*

All participants and their solutions will need to proof, that they are
conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are
applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

Core service providers implementing their own registration solution MUST
proof their conformity by providing:

- An openAPI specification of the endpoints described

### 1.6 Terminology

> *This section is non-normative*

**Application Programming Interface (API)**

An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more
computer programs to communicate with each other.

Additional terminology used in this standard can be looked up in the
glossary on the association homepage.

## 2. Catena-X Registration API

### 2.1 Preconditions and dependencies

The registration API is exposed to the Internet.

### 2.2 API Specification

### 2.2.1 API-Endpoints - Core Service Provider

The Core Service Provider MUST implement the following endpoints -- in focus
are the API business logic / content and structure, the path name might change / be
different but the business logic behind as well as the attributes must
be followed. Details to the respective MUST and SHOULD statements may be found below.

>> Note functional description and standard definition of the CSP role are defined inside the standard CX-0006-RegistrationAndInitialOnboarding.
