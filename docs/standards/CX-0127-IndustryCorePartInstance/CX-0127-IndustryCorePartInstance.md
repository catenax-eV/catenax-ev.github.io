## 1 INTRODUCTION

This standard contains all information on the "Industry Core: Part Instance". The Industry Core is a shared foundation for use cases that utilize digital twins and aspect models in Catena-X. The "Industry Core: Part Instance" describes digital twins and aspect models that are used to represent identifiable instantiated parts, such as serial parts, just-in-sequence parts or batches, and describes those in the Catena-X network. Digital twins and aspect models are meant to be reused by other use cases as much as possible, in order to simplify data provisioning across different use cases.
The "Industry Core: Part Instance" provides the basis for the identification, description, findability of part instance digital twins in the Catena-X network and the connection of those twins to build data chains across the supply chain in both directions.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This document is targeting subsets of the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider
- Enablement Service Provider

Note: Fulfilling a use-case standard by a data provider / consumer can be done in two ways:

1. Purchase a certified app for the use-case. In this case the data provider / consumer does not need to proof conformity again and
2. Data Provisioning / Consumption without a certified app for the use-case.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The aim of the "Industry Core: Part Instance" is to build the foundation to describe, identify and find a component on an instance level and enables traversing across the levels of the supply chain to ensure the creation of data chains and enable data driven use cases over all n-tier levels without compromising data sovereignty. This standard enables data and app providers to deliver solutions for building data chains for identifiable instantiated parts, such as serialized parts, vehicles, just-in-sequence parts and batches. This is achieved via the standardized creation of digital twins of those entities as well as the logical linking to their parent and child components (Bill of Material as built, Usage as Built).

The "Industry Core: Part Instance" is not intended to include all information that may be needed in an use case. Instead, it allows the establishment of a value driven data chain and serves as a basis for further data driven use cases.
It enables data owners to provide necessary data with individual access rights and usage restrictions (access and usage policies) to ensure privacy and security. Additional information might be shared by utilizing the Asset Administration Shell through additional aspects or submodels.

The "Industry Core: Part Instance" is supporting the availability of data of identifiable instantiated parts and the connection to their parent and child parts. It describes the concrete digital reflection of a produced vehicle, product or part and its provisioning towards Catena-X including Interoperability and Data Sovereignty standards and components by the participants willing to share such data. This standard also defines which components (e.g. Digital Twin Registry, CX-0018 compliant connector) must be used in order to be interoperable and sovereign in a data exchange as defined in Catena-X.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

In addition to all sections that are marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are also non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants* and their solutions will need to proof, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards.
To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).
Please refer to: https://catena-x.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/certification for the process of conformity assessment and certification.

The specific criteria described in this document are describing the usage of the central tools as well as common tools described in the linked standardization documents and therefore compliance should be checked with the tools provided for these components.

The versions of the standardization documents valid for this standard are mentioned in sections where the [standalone standards](#211-list-of-standalone-standards), [normative references](#61-normative-references) and [non-normative references](#62-non-normative-references) are listed. The valid versions are not specifically mentioned in the body text.

**Disclaimer: The operating model released by the Catena-X association will define the roadmap, content and scope for the certification process. This will include the roles, certification and further assessment procedures as well as the rollout phases.*

### 1.4 EXAMPLES

Examples for data models: See according subsection [3 Aspect Models](#3-aspect-models).

Examples for APIs: See according subsection [4 Application Programming Interfaces](#4-application-programming-interfaces)

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

**Aspect Model**:
A formal, machine-readable semantic description (expressed with RDF/turtle) of data accessible from an Aspect.
An Aspect Model must adhere to the Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM), i.e., it utilizes elements and relations defined in the Semantic Aspect Meta Model and is compliant to the validity rules defined by the Semantic Aspect Meta Model.
Aspect models are logical data models which can be used to detail a conceptual model in order to describe the semantics of runtime data related to a concept. Further, elements of an Aspect model can/should refer to terms of a standardized Business Glossary (if existing).

**Batch**:
A batch is a quantity of (semi-) finished products or (raw) material
products that have been produced under the same circumstances (e.g., same
production location), as specified groups or amounts, within a certain
time frame. Every batch can differ in the number or amount of products.
Different batches can have varied specifications, e.g., different
colors, quality, etc. A batch is identified via a Batch ID.

**Business Partner Number (BPN)**:
A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-x.

**Tractus-X Eclipse Dataspace Connector (Tractus-X EDC)**:
The Tractus-X EDC is a reference implementation for a connector conformant to CX-0018 currently acting as a de-facto standard and/or reference Implementation within Catena-X. When mentioning the Tractus-X EDC in this standard, any other CX-0018 conformant connector is also a valid option.

**International Data Space (IDS)**:
International Data Space and its protocol for data exchange foresees a compliant connector handling contract negotiations before each data transfer and defines a general architecture for data exchange.

**Just-in-sequence-part**:
Just-in-sequence is a delivery concept where parts are delivered to the production plant at a requested time in the exact order of installation, typically for a 1:1 dependency on the manufactured product. A just-in-sequence-part is a part for which this concept and order of delivery applies and which does not have a dedicated serial number (then it would be considered a serialized part). Examples for JIS-parts are seats and bumpers.

**Part Instance**: A part instance is a physically produced instance (e.g. serialized part, batch, just-in-sequence-part) of a part type.

**Part Type**: A part type is a generic (not physically produced) part on material- or catalog-level as a representation for a designed part.

**Serialized part**:
Instance of a part, where the particular instance can be uniquely identified by means of a serial number, a similar identifier (e.g. VAN) or a combination of multiple identifiers (e.g. combination of manufacturer, date and number).

**Vehicle Anonymised Number (VAN)**:
A number mapped 1:1 to VIN, but pseudonymized.

**Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)**:
The VIN number is a 17-character code assigned by the manufacturer to every vehicle, providing specific information about its brand, model, year of manufacture, and other key features. It is a unique identifier that allows the vehicle to be easily tracked and identified throughout its lifespan.

Additional terminology used in this standard can be looked up in the glossary on the association homepage.

## 2 RELEVANT PARTS OF THE STANDARD FOR SPECIFIC USE CASES

> *This section is normative*

### 2.1 "Data Provisioning Industry Core: Part Instance"

#### 2.1.1 LIST OF STANDALONE STANDARDS

To participate in Data Provisioning for the "Industry Core: Part Instance", the following single standards **MUST** be fulfilled by all participants for which the standard is relevant:

- CX-0002 Digital Twins in Catena-X 2.2.0
- CX-0018 Dataspace Connectivity 3.0.0

#### 2.1.2 DATA REQUIRED

A digital twin **MAY** be created for serialized part, just-in-sequence-part or batch of materials produced by the manufacturer.

The digital twin **MUST** be provisioned via an Asset Administration Shell as per CX-0002 and registered in a decentral Digital Twin Registry of the data provider (or the decentral Digital Twin Registry host of the manufacturer) as described in CX-0002.

The aspect model "SerialPart" **MUST** be linked to the Asset Administration Shell of a serialized part.

The aspect model "JustInSequencePart" **MUST** be linked to the Asset Administration Shell of a just-in-sequence-part.

The aspect model "Batch" **MUST** be linked to the Asset Administration Shell of a Batch.

The aspect model "SingleLevelBomAsBuilt" **MAY** be linked to the Asset Administration Shell of each part and each batch holding the information on relationship of serialized items and batches. Information on the Bill of Material of those parts and batches **MUST NOT** be provided in any other way than with the aspect model "SingleLevelBomAsBuilt".

The aspect model "SingleLevelUsageAsBuilt" **MAY** be linked to the Asset Administration Shell of each part and each batch holding the information on usage of this part or batch in serialized items or products in general. Information on the usage of those parts and batches **MUST NOT** be provided in any other way than with the aspect model "SingleLevelUsageAsBuilt".

The submodel data **MUST** be transferred using the IDS Protocol as described in CX-0018.
The Tractus-X EDC as a reference implementation is **RECOMMENDED** to be used as a connector conformant to CX-0018.

#### 2.1.3 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

As the IDS protocol is being used, data **MUST NOT** be transferred before a corresponding contract negotiation has been successfully passed by the participants of the data exchange and a valid contract is present as described in CX-0018.
The required data offers **MUST** be discoverable through the decentral Digital Twin Registry as submodel endpoints.

#### Conventions for Use Case Policy in context data exchange

In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.

For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile). This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas **MUST** be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

##### Additional Details regarding Access Policies

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X  and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number:

- Membership
- BPNL

##### Additional Details regarding Usage Policies

In the context of data usage policies (“Usage Policies”), Participants and related services **MUST** use the following policy rules:

- Use Case Framework (“FrameworkAgreement”)
- at least one use case purpose (“UsagePurpose”) from the above mentioned [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

Additionally, respective usage policies **MAY** include the following policy rule:

- Reference Contract (“ContractReference”).

Details on  namespaces and ODRL policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

##### Versioning

The Aspect Models that are deployed as Digital Twins **MUST** be published in [dcat:Dataset](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#) in the property that holds the full URN of the Aspect Model https://admin-shell.io/aas/3/0/HasSemantics/semanticId. Versions are explicitly contained in the URN.
The API versions **MUST** be published in the property https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#version as version X.Y in [dcat:Dataset](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#).
Note: Data Assets differentiated only by major version **MUST** be offered in parallel. The current standard and API versions mark the start of Life Cycle Management in Catena-X operations. Previous versions are dismissed.

#### 2.1.4 DIGITAL TWINS AND SPECIFIC ASSET IDs

The asset's globalAssetId **MUST** be equal to the unique id used in Catena-X.

The following specific asset IDs not marked as optional **MUST** be available in the decentral Digital Twin Registry when registering a digital twin or when adding the above mentioned submodels to an existing twin for a  part instance in order to allow searching for that specific asset ID (see  CX-0002 for additional information). The specific asset IDs marked as optional **MAY** be used in addition.

The following conventions for specific Asset IDs apply to all digital twins:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Key </th> <th> Availability </th> <th> Description </th> <th> Type </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> manufacturerId </td>
    <td> Mandatory </td>
    <td> The Business Partner Number (BPNL) of the manufacturer of the part. </td>
    <td> BPNL </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> manufacturerPartId </td>
    <td> Mandatory </td>
    <td> The ID of the type/catalog part from the ***manufacturer***. </td>
    <td> String </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> customerPartId </td>
    <td> Optional</td>
    <td> The ID of the type/catalog part from the ***customer***.<br/><br/>The main reason why this property is optional is that it cannot be guaranteed that every manufacturer knows the customerPartId for their parts. If known, it is ***recommended*** to always add the customerPartId for easier lookup.<br/></td>
    <td> String </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> digitalTwinType </td><td> Mandatory </td><td> The types of the digital twin: <ul><li>"PartInstance" for serialized parts, batches, and JIS parts</li><li>"PartType" for catalog parts</li></ul>  DigitalTwinType was added to allow data consumers to search for all digital twins of a particular type, e.g, only for catalog parts by using `digitalTwinType="PartType"` as filter. Without this filter, a search for a particular  manufacturer part ID would not only return the digital twin of the catalog part, but also all digital twins of instances of this catalog part, i.e., of the corresponding serial parts.</td><td> String </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**For serialized parts, additionally the following conventions apply:**

| Key            | Availability | Description                                                                                  | Type   |

| van            | Optional     | **Only for vehicles:** The pseudonymized vehicle identification number (VIN) of the vehicle. | String |

**For batches, additionally the following conventions apply:**

| Key            | Availability | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Type   |
| :------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| batchId        | Mandatory     | The number of the batch from the manufacturer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | String |
| intrinsicId    | Mandatory    | Also the number of the batch from the manufacturer.<br/><br/>Currently, we also use the batch number as intrinsicId. This makes looking up digital twins for serialized parts and batches easier as a data consumer only has to specify the intrinsicId no matter if they are looking up a serialized part or a batch. Otherwise, the data consumer would need to know for what type of digital twin it is looking for or it would have to look for both until a match is found. | String |

**For just-in-sequence-parts, additionally the following conventions apply:**

| Key               | Availability | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Type   |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| parentOrderNumber | Optional     | A number identifying the just-in-sequence- part's destination parent part. The parent part is typically known upfront to the supplier for just-in-sequence parts.                                                                       | String |
| jisNumber         | Mandatory    | A number that is used to identify the call-off that can be assumed unique within the specific just-in-sequence process. This is typically not the sequence number, but the call-off number.                                             | String |
| jisCallDate       | Optional     | The date of the just-in-sequence call-off as stated on the call-off document itself. <br/>The value must be compliant to ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` or `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm`                                 | Date   |
| intrinsicId       | Mandatory    | A composition of `jisNumber`, `parentOrderNumber` (if available), `jisCallDate` (if available). This information is typically known upfront to the supplier `jisNumber`, `partOrderNumber` and `jisCallDate` for just-in-sequence parts. | String |

A digital twin is required for each single instance of a serialized part, just-in-sequence-part or vehicle and each batch to be traced.

##### Authorization: Visbility of Specific Asset IDs in the DTR

To enforce a strict need-to-know (and prevent data from being exposed to non-authorized parties), the visibility of entries in the attribute `specificAssetIds` https://admin-shell.io/aas/3/0/AssetInformation/specificAssetIds must be protected, i.e.,their visibility must be restricted to only the manufacturer of the part (which is represented by the digital twin) and the customers of the part. For that, the attribute `externalSubjectIds` (https://admin-shell.io/aas/3/0/SpecificAssetId/externalSubjectId) must be used. For more information on the semantics of the mentioned properties, see AAS Pt. 1. For more information on the use of Digital Twins in Catena-X, see CX - 0002.

### 3.1 ASPECT MODEL "SerialPart"

#### 3.1.1 INTRODUCTION

The semantic model SerialPart describes a submodel for a digital twin of a serialised part providing essential information about this part. A serialized part is an instance of a part, where the particular instance can be uniquely identified by means of a serial number, a similar identifier (e.g. VAN) or a combination of multiple identifiers (e.g. combination of manufacturer, date and number).
More specific, the model links local identifiers like manufacturerPartId, customerPartId and other data like manufacturing information and part type information to the actual catenaXId from Catena-X, which is a UUIDv4.
This allows decoupling of the network identifiers from the actual business process.
By accessing this aspect you can link a physical part to its representation within Catena-X.

Note: The Aspect model SerialPart **v3.0.0** is **mandatory**. Versions higher than that are **optional**, but might become mandatory in future releases of this standard.

For the changelog of the aspect model, [see here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.serial_part/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

#### 3.1.2 SPECIFICATIONS ARTIFACTS

The modeling of the semantic model specified in this document was done in accordance to the "semantic driven workflow" to create a submodel template specification [SMT](#62-non-normative-references).

The aspect model is written in SAMM 2.1.0 as a modeling language conformant to CX-0003 as input for the semantic driven workflow.

Like all Catena-X data models, this model is available in a machine-readable format on GitHub
conformant to CX-0003.

#### 3.1.3 LICENSE

This Catena-X data model is an outcome of Catena-X use case group
Industry Core. This Catena-X data model is made available under the terms
of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0)
license, which is available at Creative Commons[^2].

The license information is available in github.

In case of doubt the license, copyright and authors information in
github overwrites the information in this specification document.

#### 3.1.4 IDENTIFIER OF SEMANTIC MODEL

The semantic model has the unique identifier

SerialPart **v3.0.0** (mandatory)

```text
urn:samm:io.catenax.serial_part:3.0.0#SerialPart 
```

#### 3.1.5 FORMATS OF SEMANTIC MODEL

##### 3.1.5.1 RDF TURTLE

The rdf turtle file, an instance of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, is the master for generating additional file formats and serializations.  These can be viewed by following links:

SerialPart **v3.0.0** (mandatory)

https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.serial_part/3.0.0/SerialPart.ttl

The open source command line tool of the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework[^3] is used for generation of other file formats like for example a JSON Schema, aasx for Asset Administration Shell Submodel Template or a HTML documentation.

##### 3.1.5.2 JSON SCHEMA

A JSON Schema can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The JSON Schema defines the Value-Only
payload of the Asset Administration Shell for the API operation "GetSubmodel".

##### 3.1.5.3 AASX

An AASX file can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The AASX file defines one of the requested
artifacts for a Submodel Template Specification conformant to \[[SMT](#62-non-normative-references)].

#### 3.1.6 EXAMPLE DATA

Example JSON payload: Submodel **"SerialPart" v3.0.0 for a vehicle**

### 3.2 ASPECT MODEL "Batch"

#### 3.2.1 INTRODUCTION

A batch is a quantity of (semi-) finished products or (raw) material
product that have been produced under the same circumstances (e.g., same
production location), as specified groups or amounts, within a certain
time frame. Every batch can differ in the number or amount of products.
Different batches can have varied specifications, e.g., different
colors, quality, etc. A batch is identified via a Batch ID.

This submodel template or aspect model is required to identify a batch
of materials within Catena-X.

It links local identifiers like manufacturerPartId and batchId to
the actual Catena-X ID.

This allows decoupling of the Catena-X identifiers from the actual
business process.

By accessing this aspect you can link a physical batch of parts to its
representation within in Catena-X.

Note: The Aspect model Batch **v3.0.0** is **mandatory**. Versions higher than that are **optional**, but might become mandatory in future releases of this standard.

For the changelog of the aspect model, [see here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.batch/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

#### 3.2.2 SPECIFICATIONS ARTIFACTS

The modeling of the semantic model specified in this document was done in accordance to the "semantic driven workflow" to create a submodel template specification [SMT](#62-non-normative-references).

### 3.3 ASPECT MODEL "JustInSequencePart"

#### 3.3.1 INTRODUCTION

This submodel template or aspect model is required to identify a just-in-sequence-part within Catena-X (that do not have a dedicated serial number).
It links local identifiers like manufacturerPartId, jisNumber and jisCallDate to
the actual Catena-X ID.
This allows decoupling of the Catena-X identifiers from the actual
business process.
By accessing this aspect you can link a physical just-in-sequence-part to its
representation within in Catena-X.

For just-in-sequence-parts with an existing serial number, the aspect model SerialPart is applied, not JustInSequencePart.

Note: The Aspect model JustInSequencePart **v3.0.0** is **mandatory**. Versions higher than that are **optional**, but might become mandatory in future releases of this standard.

### 3.4 ASPECT MODEL "SingleLevelBomAsBuilt"

#### 3.4.1 INTRODUCTION

The "Industry Core: Part Instance" aims on building product genealogy information throughout
the supply chain. Therefore it is required to link a produced part with
its predecessor and its successor items.
SingleLevelBoMAsBuilt is the submodel to build such a predecessor linkage between the digital twins. It contains the unique identifiers of the predecessor items of a produced or assembled part and therefore
allows top-down navigation through the supply chain by Catena-X identifiers.

More specific, the aspect provides information on the child
items (one structural level down) from which the given object is
assembled. In first priority, it creates the relationship of one part instance in the asBuilt lifecycle phase with its child items by referencing the part instance digital twin of such item. However, when no part instance digital twin of the child item exists to reference, it is in a second priority possible to reference the part type twin of the child item instead.

Because of gap of information in the production, it is sometimes not possible to identify the single correct digital twin to reference, but just a subset of potential twins. Then all potential alternative twins may be referenced. This will be marked by setting the property "hasAlternatives" true. If the exact digital twin is known, regardless of if it is a part type or part instance, just this one will be referenced and "hasAlternative" will be false.

This model was modelled conform to the Catena-X standard CX-0045 Aspect Model Data Chain Template.

Note: The Aspect model SingleLevelBomAsBuilt **v3.0.0** is **mandatory**. Versions higher than that are **optional**, but might become mandatory in future releases of this standard.

### 3.5 ASPECT MODEL "SingleLevelUsageAsBuilt"

#### 3.5.1 INTRODUCTION

The "Industry Core: Part Instance" aims on building product genealogy information throughout the supply
chain. Therefore it is required to link a produced part with its predecessor items and its successor items.
SingleLevelUsageAsBuilt is the submodel to build a successor linkage between the digital twins. It contains the
customers and the unique identifiers of the successor items (usage) of a produced or assembled product and
therefore allows bottom-up navigation through the supply chain by Catena-X identifiers.

More specific, the aspect provides information on the customers and the parent items (one structural level up) that are produced or assembled from the given object. It creates the relationship of one part instance in the asBuilt lifecycle phase with its parent items by referencing the part instance digital twin of such item. In analogy to SingleLevelBomAsBuilt it is possible that a parent item cannot be specified at instance level and therefore no part instance digital twin of that item exists to be referenced. In that case, in contrast to SingleLevelBomAsBuilt, even if it would be possible to reference a part type twin of the parent part instead, no reference will be made.

Because of gaps of information in the production, it is sometimes not possible to identify the single correct
digital twin to reference, but just a subset of potential twins that the item has been assembled into. Then from all potential alternative twins a reference can be done. To indicate that there is more than one parent item referenced as potential alternatives, the property "IsOnlyPotentialParent" will be set true for those references. If the exact digital twin of the parent part is known, the property "IsOnlyPotentialParent” will be set false.

To be able to reference the unique identifiers of the successor items (usage) the data provider of this aspect model has to rely on their customer to provide them the correct information of that item. If the data provider does not have that information they are unable to provide the sucessor item but
only the customer.

This model was modelled conform to the Catena-X standard CX-0045 Aspect Model Data Chain Template.

Note: The Aspect model SingleLevelUsageAsBuilt **v3.0.0** is **mandatory**. Versions higher than that are **optional**, but might become mandatory in future releases of this standard.

## 4 APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

> *This section is normative*

### 4.1 UNIQUE ID PUSH NOTIFICATION API

Unique ID Push notifications provide the possibility to push specific information to a business partner in the value chain (one level up). This can help to provide faster information to reduce necessary information collection activities.

The Unique ID Push Notification API **MAY** be used to push the information “Connect to Parent”  to a business partner.
The information “Connect to Parent” **MUST NOT** be provided in any other way than with the
Unique ID Push Notification API.

**Connect to Parent**

Unique ID Push notifications of type "connect-to-parent" are a way for a manufacturer to notify a customer as soon as possible when a new digital twin for a part is available.

The sender of the notification is the supplier of a part item and the receiver of the notification is the customer of that part item. The Unique ID of that part is sent in the notification.

Connect to Parent notifications **MAY** be applied to Digital Twins for part instances and for part types.

#### 4.1.1 PRECONDITIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

Application providers **MUST** prove their conformity by providing:
An openAPI specification of the endpoints described.

Examples of the data asset and contract definition structure in their Tractus-X EDC or any other CX-0018 compliant connector.

The Unique ID Push Notification API **MUST** be published towards the network using a Data Asset/Contract Definition in terms of the IDSA Protocol as described by the reference implementation [CX-0018].

The Eclipse Dataspace Connector as a reference implementation **SHOULD BE** used and is referenced in this document. Other connectors fulfilling the same standards towards Catena-X **MAY** be leveraged as well.

It is of importance to mention, that there **MUST** be an API available behind each of the data offers described in the dataspace connector, which works according to the openAPI specifications description.

Nevertheless, the APIs are **OPTIONAL** to follow the same structure, as there could even be APIs taking over the job of several of the endpoints mentioned.

The dataspace connector **SHOULD** act as a reverse proxy towards those APIs, as it holds the Data Offers linked to the respective implemented endpoints.

#### 4.1.2 API SPECIFICATION

##### 4.1.2.1 API-ENDPOINTS

The Unique ID Push Notification API **MUST** be implemented as specified in the openAPI documentation as stated here: [openAPI](./assets/unique-id-push-2-0-0.yaml)

To enable compatibility with future versions, additional, unknown attributes in the API can be ignored.

The Unique ID Push Notification API **MUST** implement one endpoint:

```text
POST/uniqueidpush/connect-to-parent
```

In fact, it is **OPTIONAL** to implement the endpoint paths exactly as described above. The reason is that those
endpoints are not called from any supply chain partner directly. Rather, they are called from the Tractus-X EDC as part of data assets. In that sense, it is just important to implement
endpoints that can process the defined request body and respond with the HTTP status codes and - if
required - reply with the defined response body.

The data assets will act similar to a reverse proxy for the notification endpoints, therefore rather the
data assets are of significance, which **SHOULD** be exposed towards Catena-X through the Data Offer
Catalogues in the Tractus-X EDC or any other CX-0018 compatible connector.

##### 4.1.2.2 AVAILABLE DATA TYPES

The notification API **MUST** use JSON as the payload transported via HTTP.

##### 4.1.2.3 API RESOURCES & ENDPOINTS

The HTTP POST endpoints introduced in this standard **MUST** be called via Data Space Protocol.
The sending and receiving of notifications **MUST** be built on the basis of HTTP POST endpoints.

#### 4.1.3 DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

##### DATA ASSET FOR UNIQUE ID PUSH NOTIFICATION RECEIVE ENDPOINT

When using the Tractus-X EDC or any other CX-0018 conformant connector, the following asset **MUST** be registered. Other connectors implementing the CX-0018
standard require a similar data asset with the same structure and provisioning towards Catena-X.

The following properties must be set for this asset:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#",
    "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",
    "dct": "https://purl.org/dc/terms/"
  },
  "@id": "{{ _.assetId }}",
  "properties": {
    "dct:type": { "@id": "cx-taxo:UniqueIdPushConnectToParentNotification" },
    "cx-common:version": "2.0"
  }
}
```

Properties "dct:type" and "cx-common:version" are used to classify the asset and are explained in the [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Digital%20Twin%20Kit/Software%20Development%20View/Specification%20Digital%20Twin%20KIT#registration-at-edc) in more detail.

#### 4.1.4 VERSIONING

The API version described in this standard document **MUST** be published in the property https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#version as version 2.0 in [dcat:Dataset](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#).
