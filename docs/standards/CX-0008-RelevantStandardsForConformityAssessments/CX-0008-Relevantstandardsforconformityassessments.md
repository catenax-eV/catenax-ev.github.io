# CX-0008 Relevant Standards for Conformity Assessments v1.1.0

## ABSTRACT

This standard is relevant for all partners that want to operate within the Catena-X network.
The document defines the internal (e.g. CX Guidelines) and external (e.g. ISO) standards that a partner needs to fulfil before he/she
can offer solutions (services or business applications) in the context of Catena-X. Those standards have been derived from
common incoterms in the automotive industry and present the minimal basis so that software can be used within an automotive
industry enterprise.

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

> *This section is non-normative*

- Core Service Provider
- Business Application Provider
- Data Provider and Consumer
- Enablement Service Provider
- Onboarding Service Provider

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

> *This section is non-normative*

The requirement for ISO 9001 certification, which was required in previous versions,
meant a high effort for the affected companies and an improper focus for IT-oriented companies like e.g. IT outfitters.
ISO 27001 and TISAX Infosec are considered suitable alternatives and therefore companies can now certify to ISO 27001 and/or TISAX Infosec and/or ISO 9001 alternatively.
Furthermore, the certification period for a first certification is extended from 12 months to 24 months.

The Business Network Provider role has been replaced with the Onboarding Service Provider role.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This document is relevant for all partners that want to operate within
the Catena-X network. More specifically, this document is intended for
the following roles

- Core Service Provider
- Business Application Provider
- Data Provider and Consumer
- Enablement Service Provider
- Onboarding Service Provider

### 1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

This document defines the internal (e.g. CX Guidelines) and external (e.g. ISO)
standards that a partner needs to fulfil before he/she can offer
solutions (services or business apps) in the context of Catena-X. Those
standards have been derived from common incoterms in the automotive
industry and present the minimal basis so that software can be used
within an automotive industry enterprise.

Requesting certain standards from partners secures that all customers
that use solutions (services or business apps) are guaranteed a certain
level of professionality, security, and trust.

Conformity with the basic standards for the roles listed above is not
optional. Without a successful conformity assessment, the onboarding
process cannot be completed. It's important to mention, that
additionally to the conformity assessment of the partner itself, the
solutions will later in the process also need to demonstrate conformity
with e.g. use-case specific standards. However, this is not covered here
but in the standards for each use-case. This document only deals with
the use-case agnostic standards on a partner level.

If you are unsure about your company's role or if you need a general
introduction to conformity assessment within Catena-X, please read the
Operating Whitepaper.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards.
To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

Depending on the role, the partner collects the self-assessments for
internal and/or certificates for external standards and sends them to
the responsible CAB. The responsible CABs can be found on the homepage
of the association: [www.catena-x.net](http://www.catena-x.net).

The partner can finalize the onboarding only after successful
verification of conformity.

## 2 RELEVANT STANDARDS FOR CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT

> *This section is normative*

The following table lists the relevant internal and external standards
per role and describes the necessary tasks to proof conformity with that
standard. Details about each standard can be found on the homepage of
the association: [www.catena-x.net](http://www.catena-x.net).

Note: Until further notice, partners will need to conduct an internal
audit/self-assessment and validate that they fulfil the respective
Catena-x internal standards. For Catena-X internal standards, a template
for a self-assessment will be provided.

The CABs -- acting on behalf of the association -- can in specific cases
allow deviation from the standards and still issue a certificate of
conformity.
