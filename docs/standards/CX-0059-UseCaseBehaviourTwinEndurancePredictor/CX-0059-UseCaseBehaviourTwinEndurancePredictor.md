# CX-0059 Use Case Behaviour Twin Endurance Predictor v2.0.0

## ABSTRACT

Behavioral product models, built on a consistent architecture of reusable functional components within ecosystems like Catena-X, unlock a wide range of innovative business ideas and digital services.

The focus of the 'data-centric and model-centric development and operational support' revolves around the 'digital behaviour twin'. This concept maps products, their functions, attributes, and business metrics by using a shared data model.

Part of this digital twin involves dynamic services providing real-time information about existing or planned vehicles. Stakeholders like automobile clubs or recycler seek specific details, such as a component's expected lifespan. This information is crucial for determining the viability of recycling components.

This standard focuses on the Endurance Predictor. The Endurance predictor receives load spectra, which has been recorded in the vehicle, through the Catena-X network. The load spectra, combined with additional product knowledge by the service provider, is used to calculate precise remaining useful life values for specific components.

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

The standard is relevant for the following roles within the scope of the Endurance Predictor service:

- data & service provider/consumer
- business application provider

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

This standard upgrades the triangle (previously CX-0059:1.2) to an Use Case Standard and consolidates the contents of the previously independent standards CX-0056, CX-0057 and CX-0058 within a single comprehensive standard.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

This document acts as an umbrella for single standards required to request "Remaining Useful Life (RUL)" data as well as providing a service for its calculation at a component level. Included are APIs to be provided by the service provider and the service requester, as well as aspect models for the respective payloads being exchanged in an asynchronous pattern leveraging those APIs.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

The standard is relevant for the following roles within the scope of Endurance Predictor service:

- data & consumer provider/consumer
- business application provider

NOTE: Fulfilling a use case standard by a data provider/consumer can be done in two ways: A\) purchase a certified app for the use case. In this case the data provider/consumer does not need to proof conformity again and B\) data provisioning/consumption without a certified app for the use case. In this case the data provider/consumer needs to proof conformity with all single standards listed in this document.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

There are two ways for implementing the Remaining useful Life (RuL) use case:

1. Using the Knowledge Agent technology.
2. Using the notification based API directly.

In order to be scalable (multiple partners/components), the preferred way is to use the Knowledge Agent.

#### 1.2.1 KNOWLEDGE AGENT

This graphic illustrates the principles architecture of the Endurance Predictor Service using the Knowledge Agent.

![architecture overview with knowledge agent](./assets/architecture_overview_knowledge_agent.drawio.png)

Since Data Transfer in Catena-X requires IDSA compliance, both parties involved must use an IDSA compliant connector and
provision the API endpoints as specific data assets in those connectors.

The Knowledge Agent functionality for the Dataspace Connector is required. This is defined in CX-0084:v1.2 Federated Queries in Data Spaces.

A standard for a semantic-driven and state-of-the-art compute-to-data architecture for Catena-X, the so-called Knowledge Agents (KA) approach. It builds on well-established W3C-standards of the semantic web.

Depending on your role, you must provide the following parts of this standard:

- **all**:
  - running Knowledge Agent Dataspace Connector extensions
- **data provider**:
  - bindings for load spectra to the knowledge graph, ideally by using a binding agent (see Binding Layer and related examples in CX-0084:v1.2)
  - graph asset, which describes and offers the data bindings in a Knowledge Agent compatible way (policies may also be required)
  - optional: a RuL skill (if you want to provide simple access to RuL calculations for yourself or for external requesters)
- **service provider**
  - bindings for a endurance predictor service (see cx-behaviour:RemainingUsefulLife within the [behaviour ontology](https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/behaviour)) to the knowledge graph, ideally by using a binding agent
  - graph asset, which describes and offers the service bindings in a Knowledge Agent compatible way (policies may also be required)
- **service requester**
  - an own RuL skill or a access to a remote skill

If a service requester requests a RuL value, he invokes the RuL skill and provides a vehicle identification number to it. This can also be done for multiple vehicles at once in a batch mode. The skill is located at or transferred to the data provider.
At the data provider, the data bindings and the service provider are resolved by the Knowledge Agent. Then, the data are transferred to the service provider via Knowledge Agent. There, the RuL value is calculated and passed back to the requester.

Although it is not mandatory to use the Endurance Predictor API (section 4) and the Aspect models (section 3) in the Knowledge Agent context, it is recommended to do so.

#### 1.2.2 NOTIFICATION BASED API

This graphic illustrates the principles architecture of the Endurance Predictor Service using the notification based API.

![architecture overview with direct API usage](./assets/architecture_overview_notification_based.drawio.png)

As a data provider you will receive a request for remaining useful life information from an outside RuL service requester via Dataspace Connector.
The data provider, which has the vehicle load spectrum data, forwards them by calling the supplier of the specific part.
After the calculation, the results are transferred back to the data provider through the Dataspace Connector and forwarded to the requester.

The present standard (CX-0138) contains two aspect models described in detail in Chapter 3.

1. Aspect Model for load spectra, acting as the main input for a component specific calculation for remaining
useful life. (See section 3.1)
2. Aspect Model for Remaining Useful Life data, acting as the main output for a component specific calculation
for remaining useful life. (See section 3.2)

It also contains the API descriptions for the APIs to exchange requests as well as results of a remaining useful life calculation:

1. API Endurance Predictor (contains both API descriptions). (See section 4.1)

The calculation and data transfers are asynchronous, therefore all parties involved in a calculation request require to provide notification API endpoints, as the results are sent back at a later stage and not as part of the HTTP response body. The notification formats are covered by CX-0023 Notification API.

Since Data Transfer in Catena-X requires IDSA compliance, both parties involved must use an IDSA compliant connector and
provision the API endpoints as specific data assets in those connectors.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

All participants and their solutions will need to proof, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the
standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).
Since this document describes a set of standards to be fulfilled, participants MUST fulfill all mentioned standards and
the respective conformity assessment criteria in addition to the specific criteria mentioned in this document.
The specific criteria described in this document are describing the usage of the central tools as well as common tools described
in the linked standardization documents and therefore compliance should be checked with the tools provided for these
components.
The Tractus-X EDC (Eclipse Dataspace Connector) is RECOMMENDED to be used as an IDSA compliant connector, as it is the current
reference implementation of the IDSA protocol.

### 1.4 EXAMPLES

The Endurance Predictor can be used in many different contexts.

OEM, TIER-X: In the early development phase, components can be designed using digital prototypes based on component-specific damage calculation. The load data required for this comes from simulation or measurement in the digital twin.

TIER-X: The overall product range becomes more attractive in the offer phase when model-based damage calculation is included as a product-related service.

During the usage phase, OEMs, car dealers and automotive clubs can further interpret the Remaining Useful Life calculation for a vehicle evaluation and offer it as vehicle-related services for their end customers and fleet operators.

Even during the usage phase, but particularly during the recycling phase, OEMs, TIER-X, automotive clubs, car dealers, insurers, fleet operators and recyclers benefit from precise residual value analyses of the entire vehicle and its components based on component-specific damage calculation.

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

- **Business Partner Number (BPN):** A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-X
- **Tractus-X EDC (Eclipse Dataspace Connector):** The Tractus-X EDC is a reference implementation of a connector for IDSA conform sovereign data exchange
- **Behaviour Twin:** Behavioral product models, based on a structured and consistent architecture of reusable and standard functional components and applied in a common ecosystem.
- **Notification:** Notification - as described in CX-0023 Notification API v1.2.2, are - in contrast to classical data offers in Catena-X - a way to push data from a sender to a receiver and vice versa in asynchronous way.
- **Knowledge Agent (KA):** The so-called Knowledge Agents (KA) approach. It builds on well-established W3C-standards of the semantic web, such as OWL, SPARQL, SHACL, RDF etc. and makes these protocols usable to formulate powerful queries to the data space. Those queries can be used to answer business questions directly (comparable to a search engine) or they can be embedded in apps to include query results into workflows with more advanced visualization.
- **Matchmaking Agent:** This component supports SparQL to traverse the federated data space as a large data structure. It interacts with the Dataspace Connector.
  The provider's Matchmaking Agent will be activated by its Dataspace Connector. Therefore, the Dataspace Connector must offer a Graph Asset (variant of ordinary data assets in the Catena-X Dataspace Connectivity standard).
  The consumer's Matchmaking Agent interacts with its Dataspace Connector to negotiate and perform the transfer of Sub-Skills to other dataspace participants.
  The Matchmaking Agents are matching the (sub)graphs and negotiate appropriated graph assets with the partner Dataspace Connectors.
- **Binding Agent:** The Binding Agent is a restricted version of the Matchmaking Agent (subset of OWL/SparQL, e.g., without federation) which is just focused on translating Sub-Skills of a particular business domain (Bill-Of-Material, Chemical Materials, Production Sites, etc.) into proper SQL- or REST based backend system calls. Implementation details: For data bindings, OnTop is used. For service bindings, RDF4J is used.
- **Ontology:** The ontology is a formal representation of knowledge that captures concepts, relationships, and properties. It allows a shared understanding and reasoning about the respective domain. It must be hosted in a way that all participants can access it. Currently, the ontology is hosted at GitHub.

Use case specific glossary of used API and SAMM models can be found in the respective sections in this standard document.

#### 2.1.3 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

##### KNOWLEDGE AGENT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The following only applies if you use the Knowledge Agent for the RuL use case.

If you are engaged as a data provider, you MUST mount your data source to the federated knowledge graph as Graph Asset. Beside the policy and contract definition, a Graph Asset registration is needed.
As a service provider you MUST make the service available as part of the federated knowledge graph, a Graph Asset pointing to your Remoting Agent endpoint is needed.

##### Conventions for Use Case Policy in context data exchange

In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.

For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed ODRL policy repository. This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas MUST be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

##### Additional details regarding Access Policies

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number.

- Membership
- BPNL

##### Additional Details regarding Usage Policies

In the context of data usage policies ("Usage Policies"), Participants and related services MUST use the following policy rules:

- Use Case Framework ("FrameworkAgreement")
- at least one use case purpose ("UsagePurpose") from the above mentioned ODRL policy repository.

Additionally, respective usage policies MAY include the following policy rule:

- Reference Contract ("ContractReference").

Details on namespaces and ODRL policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the ODRL policy repository.

##### Versioning

Note: Data Assets differentiated only by major version MUST be offered in parallel. The current standard and API versions mark the start of Life Cycle Management in Catena-X operations. Previous versions are dismissed.

The API version described in this standard document MUST be published in the property [https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#version](https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#version) as version X.Y in dcat:Dataset \([http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#)\). The requester of an asset MUST be able to handle multiple assets for this endpoint, being differentiated only by the version. The requester SHOULD choose the asset with the highest compatible version number implemented by themselves.
If the requester cannot find a compatible version with their own, the requester MUST terminate the data transfer.

## 3 ASPECT MODELS

The following Aspect Models are part of this standard:

1. ClassifiedLoadSpectrum, V 1.0.0, urn:bamm:io.catenax.classified_load_spectrum:1.0.0
2. RemainingUsefulLife", V1.0.0, urn:bamm:io.catenax.rul:1.0.0##RemainingUsefulLife

> *This section is normative*

### 3.1 ASPECT MODEL "ClassifiedLoadSpectrum"

#### 3.1.1 INTRODUCTION

The data model "ClassifiedLoadSpectrum" represents the load data of a vehicle component.  
The load spectrum is a data set that represents the aggregated loading of a component.  
Any kind of loading is covered: loading can be force or torque or revolutions or temperature or event or similar. The load data is classified and counted with specific counting methods.

This standard defines the format for the counted load data, so that the exchange of load data between different partners is possible.

#### 3.1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

The „ClassifiedLoadSpectrum" contains load data, metadata to interpret this load data and the CX ID of the assembly or component these load data are valid for.  

Load spectra counts the loading of a component in classes. Loading can be a change of a state like gearshift, a temperature distribution or the torque acting at a shaft or anything else. In a load spectrum, these loads are classified. The torque acting at a shaft, for example, has an upper and a lower limit: this interval is divided in a number smaller intervals, the classes and torque is sorted is this classes. The counting may be the time the shaft is subjected to the torque or the number of changes of torque classes.  

In the standard, arbitrary number of load channels are possible, but only one counting. For each load channel a vector with the acting load classes must be provided. The first entry in the counts vector is the counting of the combination of loads given in the first entries of the load channel vectors. Only load combinations which occur are stored. So the number of data is minimized.  

All kinds of load data and events can be covered with the standard. The counting might be time or any kind of numbering like number of events or revolutions.  

The metadata block is used to identify the right component in order to interpret the load spectrum. A component is designed for a specific application with a specific loading. To estimate the damage respectively the health of a component, a lifetime model is combined with the load data. The lifetime model is in general property of the component producer. Load data might be measured, simulated or logged during component usage.

The standard covers all classified load spectra, independent of the origin. The origin is stored in the standard.

### 3.2 ASPECT MODEL "RemainingUsefulLife"

#### 3.2.1 INTRODUCTION

The data model Remaining Useful Life contains the two relevant values to describe the expected remaining life of a vehicle, remaining running distance and remaining operating hours.  

The data model is used for vehicle parts and vehicle components which cannot be visually assessed but need the loading information combined with a damage model to estimate the health of the component.  

#### 3.2.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

Remaining useful Life is describing the actual health of a vehicle component. Remaining useful Life is defined for vehicle and vehicle components; the values are "remaining running distance" and "remaining operating hours". As it is a short-term property, the status of determination is part of the standard. Remaining useful Life is the result of a service determining the health of a vehicle component from the loading the component was subjected to. This loading might before example measured, simulate or estimated, this information on the origin of the loading is part of the standard.

#### 3.2.5 SPECIFICATIONS ARTIFACTS

The modeling of the semantic model specified in this document was done in accordance to the "semantic driven workflow" to create a submodel template specification [SMT](#52-non-normative-references).

This aspect model is written in BAMM 1.0.0 as a modeling language.

Like all Catena-X data models, this model is available in a machine-readable format on GitHub
conformant to CX-0003.

#### 3.2.6 LICENSE

This Catena-X data model is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0) license, which is available at Creative Commons.

#### 3.2.7 IDENTIFIER OF SEMANTIC MODEL

The semantic model has the unique identifier:

```text
urn:bamm:io.catenax.rul:1.0.0##RemainingUsefulLife
```

#### 3.2.8 FORMATS OF SEMANTIC MODEL

##### 3.2.8.1 RDF TURTLE

The rdf turtle file, an instance of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, is the master for generating additional file formats and serializations.

The ttl file can be found here:

[https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.rul/1.0.0/RemainingUsefulLife.ttl](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.rul/1.0.0/RemainingUsefulLife.ttl)

The open-source command line tool of the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework  is used for generation
of other file formats like for example a JSON Schema, AASX for Asset Administration Shell Submodel
Template or a HTML documentation.

##### 3.2.8.2 JSON SCHEMA

A JSON Schema can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The JSON Schema defines the Value-Only
payload of the Asset Administration Shell for the API operation "GetSubmodel".

##### 3.2.8.3 AASX

An AASX file can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The AASX file defines one of the requested
artifacts for a Submodel Template Specification conformant to \[[SMT](#52-non-normative-references)\].

Note: As soon as the specification V3.0 of the Asset Administration Shell specification is available
an update will be provided.

## 4 APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

> *This section is normative*
>
> *This section only applies if using the notification based API*

### 4.1 ENDURANCE PREDICTOR API

#### 4.1.1 PRECONDITIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

The Endurance Predictor service was designed with interoperability in mind, thus the communication in both directions (input/input) fully supports the Catena-X Notification standard. These aspects are also covered by Catena-X ontologies.
For this purpose, in the behaviour_ontology, which is part of the Standard CX-0084:v1.2 is defined accordingly.

The two APIs described support the implementation of the dynamic behavior (i.e., service) of components (e.g., engine, gearbox..) in a digital behavior twin.
As the process is asynchronous, there are two APIs for different types of participants in the network.

1. API endpoint to be provided by a Service Provider providing a service to predict the expected lifetime of a product based on load spectra.
2. API endpoint to be provided by a Service Requester application or participant to receive the outcome of such an analysis in an asynchronous manner.

It is a non-central API, which can be implemented for various components. It relies on a load spectrum as input in order to calculate and return the corresponding RUL value.
The basic idea for the functionality of this API has been derived from CX-0023:v1.2 Notification API.

As already mentioned in the Introduction, this standard provides the specification of the HTTP REST API endpoint to request (with an according Load Spectrum as input) and
sending RUL value via the Catena X Dataspace. Without this API an interoperability between different application, with an aim to receive RUL data, is not given.

#### 4.1.2 API SPECIFICATION

##### 4.1.2.1 API ENDPOINTS AND RESOURCES

The notification API MUST be implemented as specified in the [[openAPI](https://github.com/catenax-eV/product-standardization-prod/blob/main/standards/CX-0058-APIEndurancePredictor/1.0.0/src/Notification_Endurance_predictor.json)] documentation as stated here:

•  POST /api/v1/routine/notification  

In fact, it is OPTIONAL to implement the endpoint paths exactly as described above. The reason is that those endpoints are not called from any supply chain partner directly.
Rather, they are called from the Dataspace Connector or a similar IDSA compliant connector as part of its data assets. In that sense, it is just important to
implement endpoints that can process the defined request body and respond with the HTTP status codes and - if required - reply with the defined response body.  

The IDSA compliant data assets will act similar to a reverse proxy for the notification endpoints, therefore rather the data assets are of significance, which should be exposed towards Catena-X through the Data Offer Catalogues in the Dataspace Connector or any other IDSA Protocol compatible connector.

##### 4.1.2.2 AVAILABLE DATA TYPES

The API MUST use JSON as the payload transported.
The APIs payload consists of a general notification header and a use case specific content dictionary.
The request and response are linked by the unique notificationID.

#### 4.1.2.3 NOTIFICATION REQUEST PAYLOAD STRUCTURE

The main part of the content dictionary MUST follow the specification in section 3.1 "[Semantic Model: Classified Load Spectrum](#31-aspect-model-classifiedloadspectrum)" as the load spectrum itself is given as the main input towards the endurance predictor.

```json
{ 
    "header": { 
        "notificationID": "notification-UUID", 
        "senderBPN": "BPNL0000000000", 
        "senderAddress": "https://abc.com",

                  <load spectrum as per standard as specified in section section 3.1: Classified Load Spectrum>
   } 
            } 
        ] 
    } 
} 
```

#### 4.1.2.4 NOTIFICATION RESPONSE PAYLOAD STRUCTURE

The main part of the content dictionary MUST follow the specification in section 3.2 "[Semantic Model: Remaining Useful Life](#32-aspect-model-remainingusefullife)" as endurance predictor output MUST follow the semantics described in the corresponding model:

```json

    "header": { 
      "referencedNotificationID": "notification-UUID", 
      "senderBPN": "BPNL0000000", 
      "senderAddress": "https://connector-xy.com/BPNL0000000",

    }, 
    "content": { 
      "componentType": "GearBox", 
      "endurancePredictorOutputs": [ 
        { 
          "componentType": "GearSet", 
          "componentId": " notification-receipt ", 
          "remainingUsefulLife": { 
              <RuL as per standard as specified in section 3.2: Semantic Model: Remaining Useful Life>
          } 
        } 
      ] 
    } 
  } 
```

#### 4.1.2.5 NOTIFICATION RESPONSE ERROR PAYLOAD STRUCTURE

```json
{ 
    "header": { 
      "referencedNotificationID": "notification-UUID", 
      "senderBPN": "BPNL0000000", 
      "senderAddress": "https://connector-xy.com/BPNL0000000",

        "type": "Error", 
        "message": "Error Message", 
      "endurancePredictorOutputs": [] 
    } 
  } 
```

#### 4.1.3 EDC DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

When using the Tractus-X EDC (Eclipse Dataspace Connector), the following asset MUST be registered by the specific roles in this process. Other connectors implementing the IDSA Protocol require a similar data asset with the same structure and
provisioning towards Catena-X.

##### 4.1.3.1 SERVICE CONSUMER

As an application provider or an data consumer calling an endurance predictor of another participant an API for asynchronous receival of the result is required.
The corresponding data asset **MUST** look like the following:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#"
  },
  "asset": {
    "@type": "Asset",
    "@id": "endurancePredictorResult-receipt",
    "properties": {
      "dct:type": {
        "@id": "EndurancePredictorResult"
      },
      "cx-common:name": "endurancePredictorResult-receipt",
      "cx-common:description": "Asset to receive endurance predictor results.",
      "cx-common:version": "1.0",
      "cx-common:contenttype": "application/json"
    }
  },
  "dataAddress": {
    "@type": "DataAddress",
    "type": "HttpData",
    "baseUrl": "https://{{httpServerWhichOffersTheHttpEndpoint}}/api/v1/routine/notification",
    "proxyMethod": "true",
    "proxyQueryParams": "true",
    "proxyBody": "true"
  }
}
```

The variable \{\{httpServerWhichOffersTheHttpEndpoint\}\} MUST be set to the HTTP server that offers the endpoint. The path /api/v1/routine/notification MAY align with the HTTP POST path as stated in 4.1.2.1.
In that sense it can change dependent on the endurance application.

##### 4.1.3.2 SERVICE PROVIDER

As an service provider or data provider providing an endpoint for an endurance predictor service, an API for receival of the request including the load spectrum data is required.
The corresponding data asset **MUST** look like the following:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#"
  },
  "asset": {
    "@type": "Asset",
    "@id": "endurancePredictorRequest-receipt",
    "properties": {
      "dct:type": {
        "@id": "EndurancePredictorRequest"
      },
      "cx-common:name": "endurancePredictorRequest-receipt",
      "cx-common:description": "Asset to receive endurance predictor requests incl. load spectrum.",
      "cx-common:version": "1.0",
      "cx-common:contenttype": "application/json"
    }
  },
  "dataAddress": {
    "@type": "DataAddress",
    "type": "HttpData",
    "baseUrl": "https://{{httpServerWhichOffersTheHttpEndpoint}}/api/v1/routine/notification",
    "proxyMethod": "true",
    "proxyQueryParams": "true",
    "proxyBody": "true"
  }
}
```

The variable \{\{httpServerWhichOffersTheHttpEndpoint\}\} MUST be set to the HTTP server that offers the endpoint. The path /api/v1/routine/notification MAY align with the HTTP POST path as stated in 4.1.2.1.
In that sense it can change dependent on the endurance application.

#### 4.1.4 ERROR HANDLING

The following http response codes MUST be defined for HTTP POST endpoint for the Endurance Predictor endpoint.

| Code | Description                      |
|------|----------------------------------|
| 202  | Accepted                         |
| 400  | Request body was malformed       |
