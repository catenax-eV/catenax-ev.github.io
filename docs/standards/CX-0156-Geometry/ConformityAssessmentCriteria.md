# Conformity Assessment Criteria (CaC) – CX-0156 Geometry

This table defines the conformity assessment criteria for the Catena-X Geometry Standard (CX-0156-Geometry v1.0.0), following the structure described in the Guidance CAC Consolidation document. The test procedure columns are marked with 'X' where applicable for each criterion.

| Standard (CX-0156) | CaCID | Requirement | MUST/MAY/SHOULD | Inspection | Observation | Self-assessment | Inquiry | Confirmation | Recalculation | Reperformance | Analytical Procedures |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|------------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| CX-0156-Geometry  | CaC-1 | Geometry data must be attached to the digital twin as a submodel. | MUST |  |   |  X |   |   |   |   |   |
| CX-0156-Geometry  | CaC-2 | Geometry data may be attached via digital master data (CX-0154). | MAY |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |   |
| CX-0156-Geometry  | CaC-3 | Geometry data may be attached via PartType. | MAY |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |   |
| CX-0156-Geometry  | CaC-4 | Geometry data should be validated against JSON payload and should comply with JSON schema. | SHOULD |  |   |  X |   |   |   |  |   |

> **Note:** All criteria marked as "MUST" in the standard are mandatory for conformity. Additional recommendations (e.g., use of `digitalTwinType`) may be included as best practices but are not required for conformity assessment.
