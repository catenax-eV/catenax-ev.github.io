## 1. INTRODUCTION

> *This section is non-normative*

Catena-X Marketplace is a digital platform that aims to connect businesses with Catena-X certified
 applications and services and provide a seamless exchange of data and services. To ensure the
 platform's quality and stability, it's crucial to have a well-defined and documented process for
 releasing applications and services onto the platform.

This document specifies the Application and Service Release Process for a Catena-X Marketplace.
 It outlines the steps and requirements that must be followed by service providers and application
 developers when submitting new or updated applications or services to the marketplace.

The scope of this document is limited to the Application and Service Release Process and does not
 cover other aspects of the Catena-X Marketplace, such as user management, security, or data exchange
 protocols. An example service, namely "Auto-Setup", and its release and deployment process can be found
 under [3.3 REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS](#33-reference-implementations).

This document is intended for core service providers, business application providers, and any other stakeholders
 involved in the release of applications and services on the Catena-X Marketplace. It provides guidance
 on the required steps and best practices for ensuring the quality and reliability of the Catena-X
 marketplaces with preparation of enabling the coexistence of multiple federated marketplaces
 of Catena-X by following Catena-X standards.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

The following roles are relevant to the Application and Service Release Process specification for
 the Catena-X Marketplace:

**Core Service Provider**: The Core Service Provider is responsible for developing and maintaining
 the core services and components of the Catena-X Marketplace. This includes defining the release
 process and requirements for application and service releases.

**Business Application Provider**: The Business Application Provider is responsible for developing
 and maintaining the applications and services that run on top of the core services of the Catena-X
 Marketplace. This includes following the release process and requirements defined by the Core
 Service Provider.

**Enablement Service Provider**: The Enablement Service Provider is responsible for providing services
 that enable the integration of external systems with the Catena-X Marketplace. This includes following
 the release process and requirements defined by the Core Service Provider when releasing their services.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

The Application and Service Release Process APIs are key components of the Catena-X Marketplace,
 enabling core service providers, business application providers and enablement service providers
 to release new or updated services onto the marketplace. These APIs allows for the submission of
 new application and service offerings, updates to existing applications or services, and management
 of application or service subscriptions. The Service Release Process API is built
 on the `Org.Eclipse.TractusX.Portal.Backend.Services.Service` v2 specification and is accessible
 via the `/api/services/ServiceRelease` endpoints. The Application Release Process API is built on
 `Org.Eclipse.TractusX.Portal.Backend.Apps.Service` v2 specification and is
 accessible via the `/api/apps/AppReleaseProcess` endpoints.

Through these APIs, providers can perform a range of actions, such as retrieving agreement data,
 retrieving details on services or apps in review, and managing status updates. Providers can also
 add, subscribe to, and update apps or services, as well as manage agreements and consent statuses.
 Additionally, providers can retrieve information on active applications in the marketplace, view
 subscription details, and auto-setup services.

The Application and Service Release Process APIs are essential for enabling a smooth and efficient
 process for managing service and application releases and updates in the Catena-X Marketplace. Its
 comprehensive set of endpoints allows providers to easily manage their offerings and subscriptions
 while ensuring compliance with authorization requirements and role-based access controls.

### 1.3 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

> *This section is non-normative*

#### 1.3.1 OVERVIEW OF RELEASE PROCESS API

> **Note** : As Application Release Process API (found under: `/api/apps/AppReleaseProcess/`)
> is more detailed than and is a superset of the Service Release Process API (found under:
> `/api/services/servicerelease/`) only Application Release Process API is described in this chapter.

The portal backend service provides a list of API endpoints that can be accessed with
various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The APIs are categorized under
three different titles, which are Apps, AppReleaseProcess, and AppChange.

The AppReleaseProcess category contains APIs related to app management and release
processes. For instance, the `/api/apps/AppReleaseProcess/createapp` endpoint creates
an app according to the provided request model, and the
`/api/apps/AppReleaseProcess/updateapp/{appId}` endpoint updates the details of a
newly created owned app under the app release/publishing process. Some other endpoints
such as `/api/apps/AppReleaseProcess/{appId}/appStatus` and
`/api/apps/AppReleaseProcess/{appId}/approveApp` provide additional functionality such
as retrieving the app detail with status and approving the app to change the status from
IN_REVIEW to Active and create notification.

The Apps category includes APIs that allow Catena-X dataspace participants to access and retrieve information
related to apps. For instance, the `/api/Apps/active` endpoint retrieves all active apps
in the marketplace, and the `/api/Apps/{appId}` endpoint retrieves app details for an app
referenced by ID. The `/api/Apps/favourites` endpoint retrieves the IDs of all favorite
apps of the current user, while the `/api/Apps/{appId}/subscribe` endpoint adds an app
to the current user's company's subscriptions.

Each API endpoint requires authorization and access permission to be accessed. The
permission level required for each API is specified in the description of the respective
API endpoint. The authorization requirement ranges from view_apps to edit_apps and add_apps.

### 1.4 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams,
examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in
this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**,
**REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.5 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

All participants and their solutions will need to prove that they conform
with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied
correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

To prove conformity with the Application and Service Release Process standard,
 you MUST provide the following assets to a conformity assessment body:

**For Application Release Process:**

- *Release process documentation* of the marketplace implementation that is to be certified SHOULD
 match to the Application Release Process documentation and workflows
- *Documentation of API responses* of the marketplace implementation that is to be certified
 SHOULD match to the Application Release Process API responses listed under
 [2.1.1 APPLICATION RELEASE PROCESS API](#211-application-release-process-api)

**For Service Release Process:**

- *Release process documentation* of the marketplace implementation that is to be certified SHOULD
 match to the Service Release Process Documentation and workflows
- *Documentation of API responses* of the marketplace implementation that is to be certified
 SHOULD match to the Service Release Process API responses listed under
 [2.2.1 SERVICE RELEASE PROCESS API](#221-service-release-process-api)
