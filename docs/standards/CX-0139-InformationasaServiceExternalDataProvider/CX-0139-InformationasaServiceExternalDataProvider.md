# CX-0139 Information as a Service - External Data Provider  v1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

Catena-X as an open and collaborative Data-Ecosystem and the current Operating Model defines Data Provider and Data Consumer as Members of an existing Value Chain, providing and consuming Operative Data necessary for their Business Relation.
Business Application Provider are running Services, enabling and supporting these Business Processes and Collaboration, the integrated Information-Sharing is immanent and not a separate Commercial Subject. These Services are related to specific Use Cases and Standards defined in the Catena-X Framework.
Beside and beyond these kinds of sharing of Operative Data, Businesses need many Third-Party Information e.g., Material, Business Partner, Standards, Environment, Prices etc..., as well as Automotive Value Chain Processes (reflected in Catena-X Use Cases) need Third Party Information.
These are Information collected, refined (evaluated, qualified, analysed, transformed etc.) and provided by Third-Party Information Providers (Information aaS). The Source of this Information resides outside the Catena-X Ecosystem, the Information aaS-Provider has a Commercial Model for this Service.
For Information from inside the Catena-X Ecosystem the Standards are defined in existing and future Use Cases.
Information from outside the Catena-X Ecosystem is not covered by existing Standards and is matter to this Standard.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This Standard is relevant for the following audience:

Core Service Provider
Data Provider / Consumer
Business Application Provider

The Scope of this Standard is to enable Third-Party Information Provider to deliver Data from outside Catena-X inside Catena-X. This Standard is generic to every Use Case and qualifies Information aaS Provider as a potential Data Provider for a Use Case defined Business Application. The Data can be delivered only to a specific Use Case within Catena-X, realised in an certified Business Application.
By this way the Standard enables Third-Party Information Provider to deliver Data from outside Catena-X inside Catena-X and at the same time limits Data Delivery to existing Use Cases, avoiding Violations or Bypasses of existing Standards and Regulations within Catena-X. For this reason the Business Application Provider and the Third-Party Information Party Provider have a special responsibility based on this standard. The Business Application Provider is responsible for data governance with respect to Catena-X standards for the respective Use Case and Business Application. Both Business Application Provider and Third-Party Information Provider are responsible to respect existing license agreements that may be related to the provisioned data.
Not in Scope of this Standard is a Data Provider who deliver data from inside Catena-X to a Data Consumer inside Catena-X, this is regulated e.g., with CX-0007 Process Specification Minimal Data Provider Service Offering v1.0.2.
Not in Scope of this Standard is a Data Provider who deliver Data from inside Catena-X to a Data Consumer outside Catena-X, this Use Case requieres separate Regulation.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The Establishment of various Industry Networks (such as Catena-X) has increased the need to establish Data Standards across the entire Automotive Value Chain and to promote industry-wide, international Data Exchange. This Data Exchange is primarily focused on Operative Data immanent to the entire Value Chain and necessary for Business Processes and Relations.
Beside and beyond these kinds of sharing of Operative Data, Businesses need many Third-Party Information e.g., Material, Business Partner, Standards, Environment, Prices etc..., as well as Automotive Value Chain Processes (reflected in Catena-X Use Cases) need Third-Party Information.
These are Information collected, refined (evaluated, qualified, analysed, transformed etc.) and provided by Third-Party Information Providers (Information aaS). The Source of this Information resides outside the Catena-X Ecosystem, the Information aaS-Provider has a Commercial Model for this Service.
The provision of any information from a Third-Party Information Provider can´t bypass existing standards and regulations from the entire Catena-X framework related to the given Catena-X Use Case.Therefore a Third-Party Information Provider can´t provide Infromation as it is, but only to a certified Business Application Provider for a certified Business Application.
The Third-Party Information Provider must be certified for this Standard to provide Data. The Business Application Provider and the Business Application must be certified for the Standards related to the relevant Use Case.
Example:
For the Use Case Country Risk in BPDM Value-Added Services the Business Application Provider who provides the Service and the Business Application must be cerified for "CX-0081 Country Risk API". The Third-Party Information Provider, who provides Information as a Service to this Business Application Provider and the Business Application, must be certified for this new Standard "CX-0139 Information as a Service - External Data Provider"
