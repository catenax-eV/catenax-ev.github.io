# CX-0018 Dataspace Connectivity v.4.1.1

## ABSTRACT

This document specifies the communication requirements for data exchange between participants in the Catena-X data
ecosystem. The aim is to ensure interoperability and data sovereignty at the same time.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

#### AUDIENCE

The role definition is based on the definition of
the [CX Operating Model](#cx-operating-model).

The standard is relevant for the following roles, as they must be certified against it:

- Core Service Provider (A/B)
- Enablement Service Provider
- Business Application Provider
- Data Provider/Consumer

> Note: The normative section of this standard uses the DSP-definitions of "Consumer" and "Provider". Any of the
> aforementioned Catena-X-roles can assume either DSP-role.

The standard is relevant for the following role, as they must certify against this standard:

- Conformity Assessment Body

The standard is relevant for the following role, as they carry out their advisory on the basis of this standard.

- Advisory Provider

#### SCOPE

This document covers the requirements for dataspace connectivity. It describes

- how communication between dataspace participants must take place,
- which transfer type profiles have to be supported by any Provider or Consumer,
- how communication with credential services must take place,
- which conventions apply with regard to policy constraints,
- and which conventions apply to datasets.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The connector is the main technical component that implements dataspace connectivity including data sovereignty and
interorganizational interoperability. It is part of the enablement services, which are intended to enable participation
in the Catena-X ecosystem.

The following figure shows how the connector fits into the overall framework of Catena-X to exchange data.

## 2 MAIN CONTENT

> *This section is normative*

This section uses the following prefixes as abbreviations for namespaces

- `"dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"`
- `"dspace": "https://w3id.org/dspace/2025/1/"`
- `"odrl": "https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"`

### 2.1 Communication between Dataspace Participants

Dataspace *Participants* exchange data via their *Participant Agents*. They are a logical component that communicates
via a set of well-defined messages.

Participant Agents MUST facilitate data exchange according to the HTTPS binding defined in
the [Dataspace Protocol](#dataspace-protocol).

Providers and Consumer MUST expose the specified endpoints for the

- Catalog Protocol
- Contract Negotiation Protocol
- Transfer Process Protocol
- Version Metadata

as specified in the HTTPS binding of the Dataspace Protocol.

#### 2.1.1 Usage of DID in the data exchange

A Participant Agent MUST use the [DID](#decentralized-identifiers-did) in all protocol message properties that identify
a Participant. This includes properties such as `dspace:participantId` in the `Catalog` response message,
`odrl:assigner` and `odrl:assignee` in the `dspace:ContractAgreementMessage`.

### 2.2 Transfer Type Profiles

In their `dcat:Catalog` response to a `dspace:CatalogRequestMessage`, for each Dataset, a Provider MUST return a
`dcat:Distribution` signifying what Transfer Profile a Consumer can use to obtain data.

Providers MUST be able to serve data according to that signal when data transfer is requested by a consumer
via a `dspace:TransferRequestMessage`.

> Despite the IRIs of the currently used identifiers for transfer types are not yet included in the DSP-context, they
> will be used as preliminary identifiers.

Providers MUST offer at least one Transfer Type Profile. The remainder of this section provides regulations for
a non-exhaustive selection of Transfer Type Profiles. Further profiles can be defined by consecutive standards.

#### 2.2.1 HttpData-PULL

A Consumer MUST send a `dspace:TransferRequestMessage` with `"dct:format":"HttpData-PULL"`. A Provider is not required
to process the `dspace:dataAddress` property.

A Provider MUST send a `dspace:TransferStartMessage` with sufficient information in the `dspace:dataAddress` property so
that an HTTP request to the `dspace:endpoint` may succeed. The `dspace:endpointType` property MUST be
`https://w3id.org/idsa/v4.1/HTTP`. The following `endpointProperties` are to be added to the object as specified in the
table below:

| Name                                             |          | description                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/authorization`   | REQUIRED | The access token to access data. To be included in the `Authorization` header.                                                                                |
| `https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/authType`        | REQUIRED | Prefix for the `Authorization` header's content.                                                                                                              |
| `https://w3id.org/tractusx/auth/refreshEndpoint` | OPTIONAL | Endpoint to refresh the access token using the `refreshToken`. It behaves as defined in [RFC6749](#rfc-6749) section 6 using an STS-token for authentication. |
| `https://w3id.org/tractusx/auth/refreshToken`    | OPTIONAL | The refresh token to present to the `refreshEndpoint` in conjunction with the old access token.                                                               |
| `https://w3id.org/tractusx/auth/expiresIn`       | REQUIRED | Time to live for the access token after issuance.                                                                                                             |

A Provider Connector MUST ensure that the requested backend system has sufficient context from the negotiation
to evaluate the legitimacy of the request.

A Consumer may then use the provided data to execute requests against the endpoint.

> Despite the token, the endpoint still has the right to refuse serving a request. This may occur for instance when
> a consumer attempts to PUT against a resource but is only allowed to GET.

#### 2.2.2 AmazonS3-PUSH

A Consumer MUST send a `dspace:TransferRequestMessage` with `dct:format`:`AmazonS3-PUSH` and `dspace:dataAddress`
property so that triggering a transfer to the `dspace:endpoint` may succeed. The `dspace:endpointType` property MUST be
`AmazonS3`. The `dspace:endpointType` MUST be decorated with the data relevant `dspace:endpointProperties` as follows:

| Name                                        |          | description                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `region`                                    | REQUIRED | Region the bucket resides in.                                                                                                              |
| `bucketName`                                | REQUIRED | Name of the bucket.                                                                                                                        |
| `https://w3id.org/tractusx/auth/folderName` | REQUIRED | name of the folder to be transferred.                                                                                                      |
| `https://w3id.org/tractusx/auth/keyName`    | REQUIRED | path to the resource to be transferred.                                                                                                    |
| `https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/secret`     | REQUIRED | json object as string with `\` escaped double-quotes holding `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, `sessionToken` and `expiration` properties. |

A Provider MUST send a `dspace:TransferStartMessage` and an empty `dspace:dataAddress` property. They MUST execute a
transfer as specified by the received request.

### 2.3 Communication with a Credential Service

This standard assumes that each Participant has been issued a set of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) according to the
relevant Catena-X standards. These VCs are stored in a Credential Service.

A Consumer MUST be able to retrieve an access token according to the Verifiable Presentation Protocol (VPP) that is
part of the [Decentralized Claims Protocol (DCP)](#decentralized-claims-protocol). This corresponds to Request 1 in
the presentation flow where this Consumer acts as Client.

The scope of the token for requesting a `dcat:Catalog` MUST include the following credentials as defined in
[CX-0050](#cx-specific-credentials):

- Membership Credential
- Business Partner Number Credential
- Framework Agreement Credential

A Provider MUST be able to receive and securely verify an access token and derive information on a Consumer's
Credential Service in order to execute the DCP VPP Request 6. This corresponds to the role of Verifier.

A Consumer MUST include an appropriately scoped STS-Token in the `Authorization` header in all DSP messages sent
to the provider (see [DSP](#dataspace-protocol)) and in addition in the `refresh` message
(see [HttpData-PULL](#221-httpdata-pull))

### 2.4 Policy Value to Verifiable Credential Mapping

The conventions for policy constraints (`odrl:Constraint`) are defined in the Catena-X standard
[CX-0152 Policy Constraints for Data Exchange](#policy-constraints-for-data-exchange). Based on this, the connector
MUST support the verification of Verifiable Credential as described below.

The mapping between the rightOperands of a leftOperand indicating a credential to its referring Verifiable Credential
(described in [CX-0050 CX-Specific Credentials](#cx-specific-credentials)) is done via the credential type and its
version.

- The given rightOperand needs to be separated by the first “:” to separate the version term. Only one separator is
  allowed.

- Thereafter, the term “Credential” needs to be appended to identify the relevant credential via its credential type.

- The version maps the “contractVersion” property inside the relevant credential.

Example (rightOperand to Credential):

- DataExchangeGovernance:x.x -> DataExchangeGovernanceCredential with contractVersion “x.x”

Note: Versions are to be handled as strings / literals and do not require any semantic comparison.

### 2.5 Conventions for Datasets

A Provider MUST annotate all instances `dcat:Dataset` in a `dcat:Catalog` with the following properties:

- `dct:type` holding an object with at least an `@id` property pointing to a concept describing what type of API this
  Dataset represents. Subsequent standards define the exact value this property shall hold, depending on the Business
  scenario. The set of concepts is maintained in the taxonomy `https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#` and MUST extend the
  concept `https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#Asset`.
- `cx-common:version` holding a string with SemVer semantics indicating the API version of the API that was typed by
  the `dct:type` property. It is allowed to use version information that is incomplete according to SemVer.
  Subsequent standards define the exact value this property shall hold, depending on the Business scenario.

### 2.6 Participant Agent Management

A `dcat:Catalog` offered by a providers Participant Agent MUST provide only `dcat:Dataset` instances that can be
negotiated with the same Participant Agent.

A provider SHOULD publish all Participant Agents that should be detectable by a Consumer by specifying the participants
version endpoint address in the DID document as specified in the [CX-0049 DID Document standard](#did-document). The
endpoint address has the format `https://subdomain.provider-domain.com/subpath/.well-known/dspace-version`,
with `subpath` being an a arbitrary path below the providers chosen domain.

The path `https://subdomain.provider-domain.com/subpath` MUST be the path used for registration of the connector at the
Core Service B Provider.

The content of the `dspace-version` endpoint is defined in section on
[protocol version handling](#27-protocol-version-handling)

The definition of the service reference reflects the section `Discovery of Service Endpoints` in the
[DSP spec](#dataspace-protocol).

### 2.7 Protocol Version Handling

A provider MUST provide the `version metadata endpoint` at the url
`https://subdomain.provider-domain.com/subpath/.well-known/dspace-version` returning a response object as defined in
the section on [Exposure of version in the DSP spec](#dataspace-protocol). An example for the response object is:

```json
{
  "protocolVersions": [
    {
      "version": "2025-1",
      "path": "/2025-1",
      "binding": "HTTPS"
    },
    {
      "version": "0.8",
      "path": "",
      "binding": "HTTPS"
    }
  ]
}
```

The reference point of the given path segments in the response object is the base path that hosts the version
metadata endpoint, i.e., in the described case `https://subdomain.provider-domain.com/subpath`. For example, from
the given information, the path to access the `2025-1` version of the catalog service is
`https://subdomain.provider-domain.com/subpath/2025-1/catalog` and the path for the old protocol version `0.8` is
`https://subdomain.provider-domain.com/subpath/catalog`.

A Consumers Participant Agent MUST evaluate the protocol versions supported by the targeted Provider and MUST limit
the use of protocol versions to the latest offered by the Provider.

A Providers Participant Agent MUST be capable to identify by the called DSP api, which version the Consumer
is using for the communication and MUST answer with the right response formats according to that version.

The definition of the version management reflects the section `Exposure of versions` in the
[DSP spec](#dataspace-protocol).

## 3 BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

Backward compatibility is handled by the Dataspace Protocol version used for the communication between two participant
agents. All differences are handled by explicit versioning of the protocol. This includes changes in details that are
not motivated by the Dataspace Protocol itself but by semantic changes attached to the protocol version update.

Note: The previous version of the CX-0018 standard had a bug. The actual version used previously was DSP version `0.8`
which MUST be used as key for referring to the previous version in the `version metadata endpoint`.

Based on this constraint, backward compatibility is handled by the mechanism specified in
[section 2.7](#27-protocol-version-handling).

A Provider using the older standard version might neither provide discovery information in the DID document, nor provide
the `version metadata endpoint`. In such cases, the Consumer Participant Agent MUST assume the provider to use the old
protocol version and the centralized discovery mechanism to find the Participant Agents base endpoint.
