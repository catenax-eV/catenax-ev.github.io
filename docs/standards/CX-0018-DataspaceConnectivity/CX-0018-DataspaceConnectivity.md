# CX-0018 Dataspace Connectivity v.3.2.0

## ABSTRACT

This document specifies the communication requirements for data exchange between participants in the Catena-X data
ecosystem. The aim is to ensure interoperability and data sovereignty at the same time.

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

- Rename IATP to DCP
- Improve the reference of external standards to clearly express the valid versions
- Add quality checks of the previous Data Sovereignity quality gate checks as appropriate for this standard

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

#### AUDIENCE

The role definition is based on the definition of
the [CX Operating Model](#cx-operating-model).

The standard is relevant for the following roles, as they must be certified against it:

- Core Service Provider (A/B)
- Enablement Service Provider
- Business Application Provider
- Data Provider/Consumer

> Note: The normative section of this standard uses the DSP-definitions of "Consumer" and "Provider". Any of the
> aforementioned Catena-X-roles can assume either DSP-role.

The standard is relevant for the following role, as they must certify against this standard:

- Conformity Assessment Body

The standard is relevant for the following role, as they carry out their advisory on the basis of this standard.

- Advisory Provider

#### SCOPE

This document covers the requirements for dataspace connectivity. It describes

- how communication between dataspace participants must take place,
- which transfer type profiles have to be supported by any Provider or Consumer,
- how communication with credential services must take place,
- which conventions apply with regard to policy constraints,
- and which conventions apply to datasets.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The connector is the main technical component that implements dataspace connectivity including data sovereignty and
interorganizational interoperability. It is part of the enablement services, which are intended to enable participation
in the Catena-X ecosystem.

The following figure shows how the connector fits into the overall framework of Catena-X to exchange data.

## 2 MAIN CONTENT

> *This section is normative*

This section uses the following prefixes as abbreviations for namespaces

- `"dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"`
- `"dspace": "https://w3id.org/dspace/2024/1/"`
- `"odrl": "https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"`
- `"dcat": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#"`

### 2.1 Communication between Dataspace Participants

Dataspace *Participants* exchange data via their *Participant Agents*. They are a logical component that communicates
via a set of well-defined messages.

Participant Agents MUST facilitate data exchange according to the HTTPS binding defined in the [Dataspace Protocol](#dataspace-protocol).

Providers and Consumer MUST expose the specified endpoints for the

- Catalog Protocol
- Contract Negotiation Protocol
- Transfer Process Protocol
- Version Metadata

as specified in the HTTPS binding of the Dataspace Protocol 2024-01.

#### 2.1.1 Usage of BPNL in the data exchange

A Participant Agent that provides data MUST use the BPNL of the respective Participant in any DSP request/response messages.

A Participant Agent that consumes data MUST use the BPNL of the respective Participant in any DSP request/response messages.

### 2.2 Transfer Type Profiles

In their `dcat:Catalog` response to a `dspace:CatalogRequestMessage`, for each Dataset, a Provider MUST return a
`dcat:Distribution` signifying what Transfer Profile a Consumer can use to obtain data.

Providers MUST be able to serve data according to that signal when data transfer is requested by a consumer
via a `dspace:TransferRequestMessage`.

> Despite the IRIs `dspace:HttpData-PULL` and `dspace:AmazonS3-PUSH` are not yet included in the DSP-context, they will
> be used as preliminary identifiers.

Providers MAY offer any of the following Transfer Type Profiles:

#### 2.2.1 HttpData-PULL

A Consumer MUST send a `dspace:TransferRequestMessage` with `dct:format`:`dspace:HttpData-PULL` and an
empty `dspace:dataAddress` property.

A Provider MUST send a `dspace:TransferStartMessage` with sufficient information in the `dspace:dataAddress` property so
that a request to the `dspace:endpoint` may succeed when decorated with HTTP-headers constructed from
the `dspace:endpointProperties`' with `dspace:name` as key and `dspace:value` as value respectively.

A Provider Connector MUST ensure that the requested backend system has sufficient context from the negotiation
to evaluate the legitimacy of the request.

A Consumer may then use the provided data to execute requests against the endpoint.

> Despite the token, the endpoint still has the right to refuse serving a request. This may occur for instance when
> a consumer attempts to PUT against a resource but is only allowed to GET.

#### 2.2.2 AmazonS3-PUSH

A Consumer MUST send a `dspace:TransferRequestMessage` with `dct:format`:`dspace:AmazonS3-PUSH` and
a `dspace:dataAddress` property
so that triggering a transfer to the `dspace:endpoint` decorated with the data relevant `dspace:endpointProperties` may
succeed.

A Provider MUST send a `dspace:TransferStartMessage` and an empty `dspace:dataAddress` property. He MUST execute a
transfer
as specified by the received request.

### 2.3 Communication with a Credential Service

This standard assumes that each Participant has been issued a set of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) according to the
relevant Catena-X standards. These VCs are stored in a Credential Service.

A Consumer MUST be able to retrieve an access token according to the Verifiable Presentation Protocol (VPP) that is part
of the [Decentralized Claims Protocol (DCP)](#decentralized-claims-protocol). This corresponds to Request 1 in the presentation flow where this Consumer acts as Client.

A Provider MUST be able to receive and securely verify an access token and derive information on a Consumer's
Credential Service in order to execute the DCP VPP Request 4. This corresponds to the role of Verifier.

### 2.4 Conventions for Policy Constraints

`odrl:Offer` objects contained in a `dcat:Catalog` SHOULD carry `odrl:Constraint`s that are specified in the
[CX-ODRL-Profile](#odrl-profile). Subsequent standards are encouraged to specify further
restrictions of said profile, especially on the `odrl:rightOperand`s. The following list compiles a set of well-defined
policies that Data Providers and Data Consumers SHOULD include in their offers and guidance on how to check them. Application Providers MUST support all constraints of the following table.

| Name | leftOperand (expanded IRI) | operator <br /> (compacted IRI) | valid rightOperands (literal) | validation mechanism |
|------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| MembershipConstraint        | `https://w3id.org/catenax/policy/Membership`         | `odrl:eq` | `active` | [Membership Credential (CX - 0149)](#verified-company-identity) |
| UseCaseConstraints          | `https://w3id.org/catenax/policy/FrameworkAgreement` | `odrl:eq` | `[usecasename]:[version]` | [UseCaseFrameworkAgreementCredential (CX - 0050)](#framework-agreement-credential)<br />The exact mapping logic is specified in the section [Framework Agreement to Verifiable Credential Mapping](#framework-agreement-to-verifiable-credential-mapping) |
| ContractReferenceConstraint | `https://w3id.org/catenax/policy/ContractReference`  | `odrl:eq` | `[string]:[version]` | The value comparison necessary for validation SHOULD be based on [CX-ODRL-Profile](#odrl-profile) |
| UsagePurposeConstraint      | `https://w3id.org/catenax/policy/UsagePurpose`       | `odrl:eq` | `[string]:[version]` | The value comparison used necessary for validation SHOULD be based on [CX-ODRL-Profile](#odrl-profile) |

Note: The list is available in machine-readable form with links to the respective legal documents in the
[CX-ODRL-Profile](#odrl-profile).

Each Data Offer visible in a Provider's `dcat:Catalog` MUST include at least an `odrl:Constraint` according to the definition of *UseCaseContraint* as defined above.

Providers SHOULD chain constraints (if necessary) via `odrl:and`. Examples can be found
in [CX-ODRL-Profile](#odrl-profile).

Providers MUST perform access control checks based on CX credentials on their data offers as a `dcat:Catalog` object may expose
information restricted by governance and regulation.

#### Framework Agreement to Verifiable Credential Mapping

The mapping between the rightOperands of a cx-policy:FrameworkAgreement to its referring Verifiable Credential (described in CX-0050) is done via the credential type and its version.

- The given rightOperand needs to be separated by the first “:” to separate the version term. Only one separator is allowed.

- Thereafter, the term “Credential” needs to be appended to identify the relevant credential via its credential type.

- The version maps  the “contractVersion” property inside the relevant credential.

Example (rightOperand to Credential):

- DataExchangeGovernance:x.x -> DataExchangeGovernanceCredential with contractVersion “x.x”

Note: Versions are to be handled as strings / literals and do not require any semantic comparison.

#### Catena-X ODRL Profile

To clearly identify the relevant Catena-X ODRL Profile, every policy (and their subclasses) MUST use the ODRL ‘profile’ property with an IRI referring to the Catena-X ODRL Profile as defined in [ODRL policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy) The current version is: `https://w3id.org/catenax/policy/profile2405` or in compact form: `cx-policy:profile2405`.

### 2.5 Conventions for Datasets

A Provider MUST annotate all instances `dcat:Dataset` in a `dcat:Catalog` with the following properties:

- `dct:type` holding an object with at least a `@id` property pointing to a concept describing what type of API this Dataset represents. Subsequent standards define the exact value this property shall hold, depending on the Business scenario. The set of concepts is maintained in the taxonomy `https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#` and MUST extend the concept `https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#Asset`.
- `cx-common:version` holding a SemVer-conformant string indicating the API version of the API that was typed by the `dct:type` property. Subsequent standards define the exact value this property shall hold, depending on the Business scenario.
