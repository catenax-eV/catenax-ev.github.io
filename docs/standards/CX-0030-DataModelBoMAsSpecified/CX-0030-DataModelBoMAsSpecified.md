## ABSTRACT

A core problem of the circular economy is making the right decisions. These strategies include Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish, Redesign, Recycle, Recover and Rot.
In particular, the end of life (EoL) decisions are a challenge. In order for a circular economy to scale, however, these must be supported in a standardized way. The present data model is used for this purpose. This supports the products R-Strategy Assistant & Circularity Dashboard to provide decision support for its users. In this first scope, the model should support the EoL decisions in particular.
The data provided by the data provider allows relevant decisions to be derived. This leads to higher reuse and recycling rates, an economically and ecologically balanced decision-making process and a scaled circular economy.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

The SingleLevelBoMAsSpecified defines the view of the OEM or producer of the whole product, e.g. the OEM of a vehicle. It is free of any supplier-related information and specifies the promised and guaranteed content of the whole product to the end customer.
This “top-down” view contrasts with the “bottom-up” view of the SingleLevelBoMAsPlanned, though several sub-aspects are shared. The SingleLevelBoMAsSpecified is merely one aspect, which is attached to the twin of the whole product and itself does neither introduce further twins nor reference them. Instead, it merely comprises all functional information required by dismantlers, workshops, or requestors for used parts to search for and to make a match on the marketplace.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

- Data Provider / Consumer

The purpose of this document is the description of the Asset Administration Shell submodel bill of material (BoM) as specified. It defines the view of the producing company of the produced product. The presented data model is described and illustrated in the following with the entities and properties and their interrelationships.
This chapter serves to situate the given reference implementation, to outline its prerequisites and to point out its limitations.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

There are several parties needing information about the product, be it dismantlers, workshops or the owners. With the aspect model "as Planned" there is already a model which contains interesting information for these groups. However, this model also reveals sensitive information about the manufacturer, for example supplier relationships. This creates a conflict between the need for information of the exploiting/using parties and the data sovereignty of the manufacturer. This conflict is solved by the given aspect model "BoMAsSpecified" by providing a top-down view of the product and its components. Together with the aspect model "PartAsSpecified", "BomAsSpecified" provides an abstraction layer for other Catena-X members to obtain relevant information about the product while protecting sensitive information of the manufacturer.

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

The following terms are especially relevant for the understanding of the standard:

Business Partner Number (BPN)
: A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-x

End of life vehicle (EoL vehicle)
: 'End-of life vehicle' means a vehicle which is waste within the meaning of Article 1(a) of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste (waste means any substance or object which the holder disposes of or is required to dispose of pursuant to the provisions of national law in force).

The purpose of this document is the description of the Asset Administration Shell submodel SingleLevelBoMAsSpecified. It defines Bill of Material and all relevant attributes. The presented data model is described and illustrated in the following with the entities and properties and their interrelationships.

Every data provider **MUST** provide the data
conformant to the semantic model specified in this document.

The unique identifier of the semantic model specified in this document
**MUST** be used by the data provider to define the semantics of the data
being transferred.

Every certified business application using the Single Level BoM As Specified data **MUST**

### 2.2 SPECIFICATION ARTIFACTS

The modelling of the semantic model specified in this document was done in accordance to the "semantic driven workflow" to create a submodel template specification [SMT](#32-non-normative-references).

This aspect model is written in BAMM 2.0.0 as a modeling language conformant to CX-0003 as input for the semantic deriven workflow.

Like all Catena-X data models, this model is available in a machine-readable format on GitHub2F2F conformant to CX-0003.

### 2.3 LICENSE

This Catena-X data model is an outcome of Catena-X use case group Digital Product Pass (DPP).This Catena-X data model is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0) license, which is available at Creative Commons4F4F.

### 2.4 IDENTIFER OF SEMANTIC MODEL

The semantic model has the unique identifier:

```text
urn:samm:io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified:2.0.0##SingleLevelBomAsSpecified
```

This identifier MUST be used by the data provider to define the semantics of the data being transferred.

### 2.5 FORMATS OF SEMANTIC MODEL

All different formats of the semantic model can be found in the github repository.

- [https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0)

#### 2.5.1 RDF TURTLE

The rdf turtle file, an instance of the Semantic Aspect Meta Model, is the master for generating additional file formats and serializations.

- [https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0/SingleLevelBomAsSpecified.ttl](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0/SingleLevelBomAsSpecified.ttl)

The open source command line tool of the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework is used for generation
of other file formats like for example a JSON Schema, aasx for Asset Administration Shell Submodel
Template or a HTML documentation.

- [https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0/gen](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0/gen)

#### 2.5.2 JSON SCHEMA

A JSON Schema can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The JSON Schema defines the Value-Only
payload of the Asset Administration Shell for the API operation "GetSubmodel".

- [https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0/gen/SingleLevelBomAsSpecified.json](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified/2.0.0/gen/SingleLevelBomAsSpecified.json)

#### 2.5.3 AASX

An AASX file can be generated from the RDF Turtle file. The AASX file defines one of the requested
artifacts for a Submodel Template Specification conformant to \[[SMT](#32-non-normative-references)].

Note: As soon as the specification V3.0 of the Asset Administration Shell specfication is available
an update will be provided.

### 2.6 SEMANTIC MODEL

The data model is described in SAMM . A html documentation can be generated from the rdf turtle
file.

So far no .md documentation can be generated. So it is recommended to not
