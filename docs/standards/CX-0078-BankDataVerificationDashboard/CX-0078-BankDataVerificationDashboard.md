# CX-0078 Bank Data Verification Dashboard v1.2.1

## ABSTRACT

The Bank Data Verification Dashboard (BDV) has to rely on a set of clearly defined verification rules
which has to be the basis to verify the syntactical and logical correctness of banking details used by CX Member Business Partners. BDV has to capture at least 112 countries, states and dependent sub-regions based on ISO 3166-1 and 3166-2 - (see Point 2.3). BDV has to verify BP Banking data records provided by each CX Member. Each BDV rule has to verify the syntactical and logical correctness of defined banking data as defined via the BDV data and rule model. They represent the business mission critical banking data attributes for at least 125 countries. The BDV verification rules have to rely on standards defined by banking data related authorized organizations (European Payments Council for SEPA, European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) for IBAN based on ISO 13616, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication
(S.W.I.F.T SC) for BIC Code based on ISO 9362. Additionally, BDV has to rely on national banking standards to complement global or regional standards related at least to the 116 countries as needed. BDV furthermore has to rely on the following Standards: ISO 3166-1, ISO 3166-2, ISO 20275, ISO 01-140-10, ISO 8601, ISO/IEC 8859-1.

BDV has to visualize the outcome of the banking verification rules via a dashboard. There a user should be able to compare the input and output of banking data quality after the BDV verification process ended.

BDV uses the Gate API CX-0074_v3.0.0 and the Pool API CX-0012_v4.0.0 based on the CX-0018 Data Space Connectivity 3.0.0
for pulling BP data records for synchronization of CX Member BP data records with the CX Member banking data. The CX Member banking data has to be send via the BDV API. The results of the BDV verification have to be stored in the BDV Logfile and should get pulled via the BDV API from the CX Member systems.
BDV has to be a client/ server cloud application which has to contain a Web Client and a Cloud Servicer Application.
BDV has to contain a user and authorization management capability aligned with the CX Portal and Marketplace user management. BDV has to support the EDC Asset function capability and has to be available in English and German language.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

*This section is non-normative.*

This standard is relevant for the following audience:

- Catena-X certified Operational Companies acting as:
  - Core Service Provider
  - Business Application Provider
  - Data Provider and Consumer

This document is focusing on the functionality of the Bank Data Verification Dashboard (BDV) as a screening and monitoring tool of banking data related quality.

BDV has to be a Value Added Services (VAS) application for Data Provider and Consumer to verify the correctness of Banking Data provided by CX Member suppliers, customers or CpDs (Conto pro Diverse) in the role of a `One Time Customer` or `One Time Supplier`.

BDV has to enrich the BP data model via a complementary banking data model. It has to contain a storage capability of statistical banking data quality outcome data over a time frame of at least 3 years.

BDV rules have to focus on the verification of the banking data quality on a syntactical, logical or rule basis. BDV does not focus on validating semantical correctness or data enrichment services.

BDV has to be able to use the Business Partner ID as described in CX-0010 Version 2.0.0 or higher documented in the standard library of Catena-X: https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library.
If used terms are not explicitly defined they rely on the standard definitions defined in the
upcoming Catena-X Business Partner Glossary.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

> *This section is non-normative*

The Bank Data Verification Dashboard has to be the verification tool of CX Member bank data records.  It has to support the validation of the correctness of banking related data provided by CX member suppliers, customers, `One Time Supplier`s and `One Time Customer`s. Furthermore, in combination with the Catena-X VAS solution Fraud Prevention it has to support the transparency if a banking data is affected by Fraud. BDV has to enable the management and monitoring of all CX member related banking details via a Dashboard and additionally the bi-directional intercommunication based on a BDV API.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

All sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

To prove conformity with this standard providing a self-audited, stated and signed document that the syntax of the number is established is needed.

### 1.4 TERMINOLOGY OF BANK DATA VERIFICATION DASHBOARD RULES

> *This section is non-normative*

The main BDV rule methodologies are described below:

**IBAN – International Bank Account Number**
BDV has to validate the correctness of the IBAN in all defined SEPA countries based on the rules defined by the European Payments Council for SEPA and the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) for IBAN based on ISO 13616. The Bank Account Number contains the individual account number, the routing number and the SWIFT Code of the bank. The verification is based on the ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 standards to secure that the BDV rule is correctly allocated to the appropriate countries and dependent states and regions as defined by the ISO norms.

**BIC – Business Identifier Code**
BDV has to verify the correctness of the Business Identifier Code (BIC/SWIFT) of Financial Institutions. The Code is based on ISO 9362 defined by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (S.W.I.F.T SC). The Code identifies an individual financial institution and the country residence based on the ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 standards to secure that the BDV rule is correctly allocated to the appropriate countries and dependent states and regions as defined by the ISO norms.

**NBAN - National Bank Account Number**
BDV has to verify the correctness of the National Bank Account number as defined by the national bank institutions.  This verification rule is based on the ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 standards to secure that the BDV rule is correctly allocated to the appropriate countries and dependent states and regions as defined by the ISO norms.

**Business Partner**  
BDV has to enable the transparency of the relation of a bank account to the appropriate business partner type as defined (Supplier, Customer, `One Time Supplier`, `One Time Customer`).

**Fraud Case**
BDV with the support of the Fraud Prevention application has to verify if a bank account is affected by Fraud. This verification has to include the information of the Fraud status and timeframe of affection.

**One time Customer and One time Supplier**
Business partners who have a business transaction with each other only once.

#### ISO 13616 IBAN Number

BDV MUST use the IBAN in all defined SEPA countries based on the rules defined by the European Payments Council for SEPA and the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) for IBAN based on ISO 13616.

#### ISO 9362 BIC – Business Identifier Code

BDV MUST us the Business Identifier Code (BIC/SWIFT) of Financial Institutions. The Code is based on ISO 9362 defined by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (S.W.I.F.T SC). The Code identifies an individual financial institution and the country residence based on the ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 standards to secure that the BDV rule is correctly allocated to the appropriate countries and dependent states and regions as defined by the ISO norms.

**NBAN - National Bank Account Number**

## 3 BDV API

### 3.1 API ENDPOINTS AND RESOURCES

The resources MUST use the well-known HTTP request methods for CRU(D) operations:

- POST MUST be used for create requests  
- PUT MUST be used for update requests  
- GET MUST be used for read requests  

POST MAY also be used for read requests, if input is not given by parameters but rather by an HTTP body to bypass maximum URL length. PUT MAY also be used for upsert requests (create or update) if this is required. A state (active / inactive) at each entity MUST be used for a soft delete, so that the request method DELETE SHALL NOT be used. Other HTTP request methods SHALL NOT be used, including PATCH.

Uploading and downloading data to/from the BDV API MUST follow a staging concept with two stages, so that consumers of the BDV API can compare what they have uploaded  into the input stage against what kind of BDV rule results and status code was provided for each bank data in the output stage. The following controllers MUST distinguish between an input and an output stage.

Data Sovereignty: The BDV API allows to upload CX Member banking details related to business partner master data and the download of banking data related quality results of related business partner data in a data sovereign way, because each Catena-X member has its own area of business partner data in BPDM, where private data (like customer / supplier relationships) is only visible to the Catena-X member.

The BDV rule set might use defined external data sources supporting the rule set as needed in validating the correctness of bank data records or providing recommendations for data enrichments. External Data Sources are e.g. ISO 3166-1, ISO 3166-2, ISO 6074, SEPA, SWIFT, ISO 9362 and others. External data sources will only get used if the CX Member using BDV will provide appropriate licenses by API to access external data sources.

### 3.2 BANK DATA CONTROLLER

The bank data controller MUST allow to create, update, or read (search / return) bank data records related to an External Identifier or BPN ID in the input and output stage. It MUST have the following resources:

|Bank Data Controller Resources |Description |
| :-: | :-: |
|PUT/api/bdv/input/bank data |Creates bank data record or updates existing bank data record in the input stage. |
|GET/api/bdv/output/bank data record|Returns bank data record from the output stage by different search parameters |
|GET/api/bdv/input/bank data records|Returns bank data record rule status codes by different search parameters from the BDV changelog. |

### 3.3 BANK DATA SHARING STATE CONTROLLER

The sharing state controller MUST allow to create, update, or read sharing state entries of bank data records.  The sharing state controller MUST have the following resources:

|Sharing State Resources |Description |
| :-: | :-: |
|GET/api/bdv/sharing-state |Returns sharing states of bank data  filtered by IBAN, BIC, NBAN, External Identifier, BPN ID and type, country and status code |
|PUT/api/bdv/sharing-state |Creates or updates a sharing state of a bank data record |

### 3.4 AVAILABLE DATA TYPES

The API **MUST** use JSON as the payload format transported via HTTP. Other formats can be added. These are then, however, **OPTIONAL**.

### 3.5 DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

The following data assets **MUST** be registered at the Core Service Provider so that the Sharing Member can negotiate an API usage contract with the Core Service Provider and access its dedicated BPDM Gate (hosted by the Core Service Provider) through these data assets [^6]:

| **Name**                             | **Type** | **Version** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FullAccessBDVInputOutputForSharingMember  | BDV | 1.0         | Grants the Sharing Member full access to the BDV Admin function, BDV database and BDV changelog. This can be used for create and update of banking data records, to read banking data record rule status in the BDV changelog,  create / update DQD admin settings by Sharing Member role by BDV function, activate and deactivate the usage of external data sources via defined APIs and license keys. |
| ReadAccessDQDOutputForSharingMember  | BDV | 1.0         | Grants the Sharing Member read access of the BDV changelog, banking data records, BDV rule result statistics.                                                                                                                         |

The OAuth2 client permissions **MUST** be configured to solely allow access to the API resources defined in the corresponding asset, checking HTTP method (read vs. full access), path, query parameters and body of the HTTP request.
