## 1 INTRODUCTION

The document deals with the initial registration process which is the initial
mandatory step for new Catena-X network participants.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Core Service Provider
- Onboarding Service Provider

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

In order to register participants, the Core Service Provider operates a registration service where a registering company can enter its details to initiate the registration process.

The interaction between Core Service Provider and Onboarding Service Provider is defined in this standard.

Figure 1 shows a high-level view of a section of Catena-X. It consists of the
following building blocks:

- Catena-X Core Services -- Basic services, like for example discovery
   services, used by all participants of Catena-X. The core services are
   standardized by the Catena-X consortium.

- Participants environments -- A participant can offer and consume
    data. For this, he needs an Eclipse Dataspace Connector as well as
    corresponding prosumer applications. The applications are provided
    by Catena-X application providers.

- The Gaia-X Digital Clearing House (GXDCH) consists of a notarization
    service and a compliance service and can be operated by another
    party. GXDCH is a Gaia-X component and must therefore comply with
    the corresponding Gaia-X standards. GXDCH on the one hand verifies
    the legitimacy of Catena-X participants and on the other hand it
    ensures the creation of Gaia-X compliant self-descriptions.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards.
To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

The registration process described in this document serves as reference
for future implementations. Core service providers and Onboarding Service Providers implementing
their own registration solution MUST demonstrate compliance by:

- Providing documentation of the registration process implemented.
- Proofing that the registration process includes all the mandatory steps as defined in this standard.
- Proofing that the registration process implemented delivers the mandatory results as detailed in this standard.

## 2 THE REGISTRATION PROCESS

#### 2.3.3.6 Submit registration

Onboarding service providers and core service providers **MUST** provide a mechanism for submitting

---

#### 2.3.4 Company Data Validation

Once the company data are collected, it must be validated to ensure accuracy and completeness. The following validation checks **MUST** be performed:

- Verify that all required fields are filled out

whether the company to be onboarded is already registered.

#### 2.3.5 Business Partner Number Creation

After the company data is validated, a unique business partner number must be generated for the registered company (if not already existing). The business partner number serves as a unique identifier for the company within the dataspace.
The generation of the BPN as well as the to-be-used algorithm is covered in the business partner number standard.

- Onboarding service providers / core service providers **MUST** ensure that a Business Partner Number (BPN) exists or is created and linked to the company being registered.

#### 2.3.6 Wallet Tenant Creation

A wallet tenant needs to be created for the registered company. A wallet tenant allows the company to securely store and manage digital credentials and assets in their own separated tenant/instance.
CSPs and OSPs should have a mechanism in place to create a wallet tenant associated with the registered company. The wallet tenant should be securely provisioned and accessible only to authorized individuals.

- Onboarding service providers / core service providers **MUST** ensure that a Managed Identity Wallet is created for the company to be onboarded. The BPN **MUST** be stored in the Managed Identity Wallet as a verifiable credential and serves as a unique ID.

#### 2.3.7 Credential Storage

As part of the registration process, the company's credentials (e.g., digital certificates, authentication tokens) must be securely stored. These credentials are used for authentication and authorization purposes.
CSPs should implement secure storage mechanisms to protect the company's credentials from unauthorized access or tampering.

#### 2.3.8 Gaia-X

- Onboarding service providers / core service providers **MUST** ensure that a company compliance check is executed by an official Gaia-X Digital Clearing House (GXDCH). In alignment with onboarding
service providers / core service providers, GXDCH issues verifiable credentials.

The SD **MUST** be stored in a central location and **MUST** be in line with the GAIA-X standards/guidelines.

#### 2.3.9 Registration Approval and Dataspace Access

- Only when all checks have been successfully passed, the onboarding service providers / core service providers **MUST** provide access to the services. If one or several application validation steps have not been passed, the onboarding service providers / core service providers **MUST** reject the registration or defer it for revision.
- Onboarding service providers / core service providers **MUST** provide feedback (success/rejection/revision) to the to be registered company.

### 2.4 TECHNICAL INTEGRATION

Onboarding service providers / core service providers **MUST** provide onboarding companies with
information on the step required to complete technical onboarding (connector registration, technical user creation, etc.).

Onboarding service providers / core service providers **MAY** support with the technical onboarding
(integration of corporate identity provider, connector registration, technical user creation, etc.).

## 3. ONBOARDING SERVICE PROVIDER

An Onboarding Service Provider helps companies register at Catena-X for the first time.
The motivation for this may be that an onboarding service provider wants to make it easier for its
own customers to get onboarded to Catena-X, or to make the Catena-X onboarding process smoother in
general. The to be onboarded company only interacts with the Onboarding Service Provider for registration.

This chapter describes how to enroll on Catena-X with the help of an Onboarding Service Provider.

### 3.1 HOW TO BECOME AN ONBOARDING SERVICE PROVIDER

- The Onboarding Service Provider **MUST** fulfill the conformance criterias defined in
CX – 0008 RELEVANT STANDARDS FOR CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT

registration process defined in this document.
- Core Service Provider and Onboarding Service Provider **MUST** have a contractual relationship
which considers / respects / includes Catena-X standards, principles and data processing. To enable
the Onboarding Service Provider to act on behalf of the Core Service Provider.
- Core Service Provider and Onboarding Service Provider **MUST** implement registration interfaces according to CX - 0009 CATENA-X REGISTRATION API.
- The Core Service Provider **MUST** validate the Onboarding Service Provider trustability and
validate the implemented data security processes. For example
  - Sensitive data - such as access credentials - **MUST** be secured using state-of-the-art methods.
  - Registration tools provided by the onboarding service **MUST** be secured against security vulnerabilities.
- The Core Service Provider **MUST** provide Onboarding Service Providers secure access to the

This includes the sending of a registration status notification response back to the Onboarding Service Provider (see 6 - 8 in Figure 3).

The registration API is specified in CX - 0009 CATENA-X REGISTRATION API.

**Who may register with Catena-X using an Onboarding Service Provider**

The Onboarding Service Provider **SHOULD** only allow companies that add value to Catena-X to
