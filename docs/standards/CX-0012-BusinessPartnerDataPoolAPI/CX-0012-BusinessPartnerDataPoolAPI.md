## ABSTRACT

The Business Partner Data Management (BPDM) is a distributed service-based system, composed of a set of dedicated services, that simultaneously serve multiple stakeholders. It is based on a central data pool of business partners, which is consistent with the overall design principles of Catena-X. The main target is to create business partner data records (such as customer/supplier) with a high quality and currentness, to provide other processes with these data. This results in less rework and adjustment due to better master data quality which ultimately leads to an overall cost reduction for participating companies. Additionally, Value Added Services shall be offered to enrich those business partner data sets even further and give additional information or warnings about the business partners. Getting a 360° view on your business partners also helps with reducing costs and achieving process excellence because better decisions can be made.

The Business Partner Pool collects business partner data records which are cleansed and enriched, so-called Golden Records, and makes them available. It is a main component of the architecture framework at Catena-X, as it enables the Catena-X Members to leverage accurate, complete, and consistent business partner data for Catena-X applications and shared services.

The Business Partner Pool can be accessed via the standardized API described in this standard.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following audience:

- Core Service Provider
- Onboarding Service Provider
- Business Application Provider
- Data Provider and Consumer

This document focuses on the Business Partner Pool API (short: Pool API) that is part of the Business Partner Data Management (BPDM) described on the [BPDM Catena-X Website](https://catena-x.net/en/offers-standards/bpdm). It is relevant for Core Service Providers who want to provide services for retrieving a cleansed, high-quality business partner data record (Golden Record) for a given business partner number (BPN). It is also relevant for onboarding service providers, business application providers as well as data providers and consumers who want to use such services.

Not in scope are the structure and logic of the business partner number itself and the mechanism on how the business partner number is issued. There is a separate standard for this: CX-0010 Business Partner Number 2.1.0.

Not in scope is the way of how business partner data records can be shared to create a Golden Record. There is a separate standard for this: CX-0074 Business Partner Data Gate API 3.1.0.

Not in scope are the requirements of cleansing and enriching the business partner data records with the aim to create a Golden Record. There is a separate standard for this: CX-0076 Golden Record End to End Requirement Standards 1.3.0.

You can find the other standards in the [Catena-X standard library](https://catena-x.net/en/standard-library).

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The Pool API is a crucial core component in Catena-X and its platform capability BPDM because it contributes to the following functions:

1. Data Consistency: The Pool API ensures that all data related to business partners is consistent and up-to-date and can be accessed by all consumers of the API. This helps to reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies in business partner information.
2. Centralized Data Management: The Pool API provides a centralized repository for business partner data, making it easier to manage, maintain, and update information.
3. Data Governance: The Pool API is the basis for a data governance framework and helps to enforce data quality standards, such as data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. This helps to ensure that business partner data is of high quality and can be trusted for use in various business processes.
4. Interoperability: The Pool API provides an interoperable and standardized way to access business partner data, ensuring both Core Service Provider interchangeability and streamlined data accessibility for all consumers of the API.

There is a reference implementation for the [Business Partner Data Pool API (6.1.x)](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/tree/3579e50d6200b6a7ce2a9da811475cff4cbffe06/bpdm-pool-api/src/main/kotlin/org/eclipse/tractusx/bpdm/pool/api) on GitHub. It is part of a Spring Boot Kotlin open-source software project under the hood of the Eclipse Foundation and follows the Apache 2.0 licenses.

For the complete and up-to-date BPDM setup refer to the [Eclipse Tractus-X BPDM GitHub repository (6.1.x)](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/blob/3579e50d6200b6a7ce2a9da811475cff4cbffe06/README.md).

For an architecture overview refer to the [BPDM ARC42 documentation (6.1.x)](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/tree/3579e50d6200b6a7ce2a9da811475cff4cbffe06/docs/architecture).

To use the Pool API in the BPDM use case apart from this standard, the following other standards should be considered by all participants for which this standard is relevant:

- CX-0018 Dataspace Connectivity 3.1.0

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

If sections are marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in these sections are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14), [RFC2119](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-rfc2119), [RFC8174](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

When implementing the API defined in this standard, proof of conformity must be provided by the following deliverables:

- An OpenAPI specification defining the relevant resources for this standard
- Examples of data assets

### 1.4 EXAMPLES

Intentionally left blank.

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

#### 1.5.1 GENERAL

**Golden Record:** Golden Record defines a business partner data record which successfully passed a set of predefined quality rules. These rules qualified the data record into a harmonized, standardized, and semantically unified data structure which is defined by Catena-X. The Golden Record status is a prerequisite for each BP data record to receive a valid BPN.

#### 1.5.2 DATA MODEL

This chapter explains the data model[^1] from a conceptual / terminology point of view. It does not include technical details of the API data model, such as:

- differences in response and request
- differences in data stages (like input or output)
- attributes for pagination
- singular query parameters, which are not already attributes of the entities

##### 1.5.2.1 BUSINESS PARTNER

![Business Partner](./assets/diagrams/class/business-partner.png)

In general, a business partner is any entity (such as a customer, a supplier, an employee, or a service provider) that does business with another entity.

In Catena-X, a business partner is an organization (such as an enterprise or company, university, association, etc., and not a natural person) or one of its substructures that acts as unique partner within the automotive supply chain - either in the role of a direct participant, or a consultant, or a non-production-material (NPM) supplier.

BPDM distinguishes between three business partner types to represent an organization or one of its substructures relevant for the automotive supply chain (see detailed definitions): legal entity, site, and address[^2].

##### 1.5.2.2 LEGAL ENTITY

![Legal Entity](./assets/diagrams/class/legal-entity.png)

In general, a legal entity is a juridical person that has legal rights and duties related to contracts, agreements, and obligations. The term especially applies to any kind of organization (such as an enterprise or company, university, association, etc.) established under the law applicable to a country.

In Catena-X, a legal entity is a type of business partner representing a legally registered organization with its official registration information, such as legal name (including legal form, if registered), legal address and tax number.

A legal entity has exactly one legal address, but it is possible to specify additional addresses that a legal entity owns. Thus, at least one address is assigned to a legal entity. A legal entity can own sites. Thus, many or no sites are assigned to a legal entity. A legal entity is uniquely identified by the BPNL.

##### 1.5.2.3 SITE

![Site](./assets/diagrams/class/site.png)

In general, a site is a delimited geographical area in which an organization (such as an enterprise or company, university, association, etc.) conducts business.

In Catena-X, a site is a type of business partner representing a physical location or area owned by a legal entity, where a production plant, a warehouse, or an office building is located.

A site is owned by a legal entity. Thus, exactly one legal entity is assigned to a site. A site has exactly one main address[^7], but it is possible to specify additional addresses (such as different gates), that belong to a site. Thus, at least one address is assigned to a site. A site can only be uploaded and modified by the owner (the legal entity), because only the owner knows which addresses belong to which site. A site is uniquely identified by the BPNS.

##### 1.5.2.4 ADDRESS

![Address](./assets/diagrams/class/address.png)

In general, an address is a collection of information to describe a physical location, using a street name with a house number and/or a post office box as reference. In addition, an address consists of several postal attributes, such as country, region (state), county, township, city, district, or postal code, which help deliver mail.

In Catena-X, an address is a type of business partner representing the legal address of a legal entity, and/or the main address[^7] of a site, or any additional address of a legal entity or site (such as different gates).

An address is owned by a legal entity. Thus, exactly one legal entity is assigned to an address. An address can belong to a site. Thus, one or no site is assigned to an address. An address is uniquely identified by the BPNA.

| **Attribute**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **(Data) Type / Code List / Enumeration**                      |

## 2 BUSINESS PARTNER POOL API \[NORMATIVE\]

The Business Partner Gate API allows to upload and download business partner data records to improve their quality and enrich them with additional information. The Gate API **MUST** be implemented based on the [OpenAPI specification (3.0.1)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/761a0797ebf2e35e687ebef07741d1c10675e08c/versions/3.0.1.md).

### 2.1 PRECONDITIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

To run the API, the technical components described in the [Eclipse Tractus-X BPDM GitHub repository (6.1.x)](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/blob/3579e50d6200b6a7ce2a9da811475cff4cbffe06/README.md) **SHOULD** be set up.

### 2.2 API SPECIFICATION

#### 2.2.1 API ENDPOINTS & RESOURCES

The Gate API **MUST** be implemented as defined in the following OpenAPI document: [Business Partner Data Pool OpenAPI specification (6.1.x)](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/blob/3579e50d6200b6a7ce2a9da811475cff4cbffe06/docs/api/pool.json)

The resources **MUST** use the well-known HTTP request methods for CRU(D) operations:

- POST method **MUST** be used for create requests
- PUT[^6] method **MUST** be used for update requests
- GET method **MUST** be used for read requests

The POST method MAY also be used for read requests, if input is not given by parameters but rather by an HTTP body to bypass maximum URL length. The PUT method MAY also be used for upsert requests (create or update) if this is required. A state (active / inactive) at each entity **MUST** be used for a soft delete, so that the DELETE method SHALL NOT be used. Other HTTP request methods SHALL NOT be used, including PATCH.

To facilitate the compliance assessment, this chapter additionally lists and describes the API resources of the Gate API per API controller.

The following API controllers of the OpenAPI document **MUST** be implemented:

- Legal entity controller
- Site controller
- Address controller
- Metadata controller (code lists)
- Changelog controller
- BPN controller (identifier mappings)

Note that all resources of the OpenAPI document described in the following are **REQUIRED**. Conversely, all resources not described in the following are **OPTIONAL**.

#### 2.2.3 DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

The following data assets **MUST** be registered at the Core Service Provider so that the Catena-X Member can negotiate an API usage contract with the Core Service Provider and access the BPDM Pool (hosted by the Core Service Provider) through these assets [^8]:

| **Type** | **Subject**                    | **Version** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BPDMPool | ReadAccessPoolForCatenaXMember | 6.1           | Grants the Catena-X Member read access to the Pool API. This can be used to read legal entity, site, address, legal form, identifier type and administrative area level 1 data. To that end, it also grants read access to the respective changelog and identifier mappings, as well as relational data. |

Read access for legal entities, sites and address **MUST** be restricted to Catena-X Member data (see the corresponding attribute for legal entity, site and address), because the Pool may also contain legal entities, sites and address, which are not owned by Catena-X Members.

Write resources (create and update) of the Pool API **MUST NOT** be called from outside of the Catena-X operating environment. Consequently, data assets for them are **NOT REQUIRED**.

Example data asset ([*dct:type*](https://purl.org/dc/terms/type) for asset type, [*dct:subject*](https://purl.org/dc/terms/subject) for asset subject, [*dct:description*](https://purl.org/dc/terms/description) for asset description and *cx-common:version* for asset version from the table above):

```json
{
    "@context": {
        "dct": "https://purl.org/dc/terms/",
        "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",
        "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#",
    },
    "@type": "Asset", 
    "@id": "e94272b1-9831-458f-8986-c63c4973ea60", 
    "properties": { 
        "dct:type": {
          "@id": "cx-taxo:BPDMPool"
        },
        "dct:subject": {
          "@id": "cx-taxo:ReadAccessPoolForCatenaXMember"
        },
        "dct:description": "Grants the Catena-X Member read access to the Pool API. This can be used to read legal entity, site, address, legal form, identifier type and administrative area level 1 data. To that end, it also grants read access to the respective changelog entries and identifier mappings, as well as relational data.",
        "cx-common:version": "6.1"
    },
    "dataAddress": {
        "@type": "DataAddress",
        "type": "HttpData",
        "baseUrl": "https://<host>/pool/api/v6/members",
        "oauth2:tokenUrl": "https://<host>/auth/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token",
        "oauth2:clientId": "<technical user>",
        "oauth2:clientSecretKey": "<key to the secret of the technical user in the vault>", 
        "proxyMethod": true,
        "proxyPath": true,
        "proxyQueryParams": true,
        "proxyBody": true
    }
}
```

The OAuth2 client permissions **MUST** be configured to solely allow access to the API resources defined in the corresponding asset, checking HTTP method, path, query parameters and body of the HTTP request sent to the data plane public API which acts as a proxy for the BPDM Pool API[^9].

#### 2.2.4 ERROR HANDLING

The following http response codes **MUST** be defined for all resources:

- 200 - OK
- 400 - Bad Request
- 401 - Unauthorized
- 403 - Forbidden
- 404 - Not Found
- 500 - Internal Server Error

The [IANA HTTP Status Code Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) **MUST** be adhered to for the decision on when to use which error code.

#### 2.2.5 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

##### 2.2.5.1 CONVENTIONS FOR USE CASE POLICY IN CONTEXT OF DATA EXCHANGE
  
In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.
  
For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile). This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas **MUST** be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

##### 2.2.5.2 ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING ACCESS POLICIES

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number.

- Membership
- BPNL

##### 2.2.5.3 ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING USAGE POLICIES

In the context of data usage policies (“Usage Policies”), Participants and related services **MUST** use the following policy rules:
  
- Use Case Framework (“FrameworkAgreement”)
- at least one use case purpose (“UsagePurpose”) from the above mentioned [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).
  
Additionally, respective usage policies **MAY** include the following policy rule:
  
- Reference Contract (“ContractReference”).
  
Details on  namespaces and ODRL policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

An abstract class has no actual representation in the OpenAPI implementation. An entity is usually implemented by an own OpenAPI controller with resources and usually is the root in a payload, while a class is a sub node in the payload. An enumeration is a set of predefined values.
