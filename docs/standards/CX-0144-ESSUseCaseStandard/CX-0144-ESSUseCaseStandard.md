# CX-0144 ESS Use Case Standard 1.0.0

## ABSTRACT

Catena-X aims to support supply chain due diligence obligations in a market environment that miss full up- and downstream transparency. This is argued to be relevant for Environmental and Social Standards (ESS) incident tracking, without compromising GAIA-X and Catena-X principles like data sovereignty, interoperability, standardization, and use of federated services.

In case a violation against these laws occurs, an ESS incident can be created and transmitted to the Catena-X network. The Catena-X network and the ESS use case standard support the Catena-X members in this process.

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

This standard is applicable for:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

The ESS incident aspect model, which was described in CX-0113, has been integrated into this document.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act came into force on January 1st, 2023. This law regulates corporate responsibility for compliance with human rights in global supply chains. These include, for example, protection against child labour, the right to fair wages and the protection of the environment. This legislation can be added to a long list of existing and future legislation that regulate our global supply chains, like the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), the EU Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CRSD), or the International Bill of Human Rights. Companies governed by environmental and social standards (ESS) would like to determine if they are affected by an incident reported in the global supply network. Consequently, they could prove to be fully compliant with legal requirements, including but not limited to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

This standard is relevant for the Business Domain Sustainability / use case ESS incident. Scope of this document is to provide guidance about the structure of the data model and the processes behind the ESS use case.

Note: Fulfilling a use-case standard by a data provider / consumer can be done in two ways: A) Purchase a certified app for the use-case.
In this case the data provider / consumer does not need to proof conformity again and B) Data Provisioning / Consumption without a certified app for the use-case.
In this case the data provider / consumer needs to proof conformity with all single standards listed in this document.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

In order to effectively manage ESS incidents in the supply chain, a standardized approach to capturing and exchanging ESS incident data is essential. A standardized ESS Incident data model and common guidelines for the data exchange as defined in the Catena-X network provide a structured framework for collecting, organizing, and sharing ESS incident information across industries and stakeholders. Thus, the ESS use case standard supports collaboration and taking measures to ensure that the legal regulations are followed.

To participate in the ESS use case, the following single standards mentioned in chapter REFERENCES MUST be fulfilled by all participants for which the standard is relevant.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED, SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 \[RFC2119\] \[RFC8174\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove that they conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

### 1.4 EXAMPLES

For examples please refer to [ESS KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/category/ess-kit).

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

Business Partner Number (BPN): A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-X with BPN-L, BPN- S, BPN-A

ESS: Environmental and Social Standards ESS incident: An incident violating Environmental and / or Social Standards

IRS: Recursive Item Relationship is a service that can be used to recursively trace a supply chain

KA: Knowledge Agent is a standard to bring semantic web protocols into dataspaces

## 2 RELEVANT PARTS OF THE STANDARD FOR SPECIFIC USE CASES

> *This section is normantive*

### 2.1 ESS use case

#### 2.1.1 LIST OF STANDALONE STANDARDS

The standards from other use cases that are applicable here, are listed in chapter NORMATIVE REFERENCES.

#### 2.1.2 DATA REQUIRED

The mandatory data described in the aspect model MUST be provided by data providers. The optional data described in the aspect model SHOULD be provided by data providers. The mandatory data MUST be consumed by the data consumers. The optional data SHOULD be consumed by the data consumers.

Mandatory data MUST be managed by the Business Application Providers. Optional data SHOULD be managed by the Business Application Providers.

#### 2.1.3 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The standards mentioned in chapter REFERENCES MUST be fulfilled by all participants for which the standard is relevant.

### Conventions for Use Case Policy in context data exchange

In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.

For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed ODRL policy repository. This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas MUST be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

#### Additional Details regarding Access Policies

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X  and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number:

- Membership
- BPNL

#### Additional Details regarding Usage Policies

In the context of data usage policies (“Usage Policies”), Participants and related services MUST use the following policy rules:

- Use Case Framework (“FrameworkAgreement”)
- at least one use case purpose (“UsagePurpose”) from the above mentioned ODRL policy repository.

Additionally, respective usage policies MAY include the following policy rule:

- Reference Contract (“ContractReference”).

Details on  namespaces and ODLR policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the ODRL policy repository.

![ESS Block Diagram](./assets/CX-0144-ESS-figure1.png)

### 5.1 INTAKE APPLICATION - CLEARING AGENCY

An incident has been reported to the Catena-X network. The incident can be reported manually e.g. by a whistleblower or automated by a Third Party InfoProvider. The unstructured information (text and/or pictures) about each incident will be collected along with country-, company-, material-related data if available.

### 5.2 CLEARING AGENCY - CATENA-X SERVICES

The Clearing Agency is prompted to clear incidents. This independent body has the tasks among others, to improve quality of data and reduce fraud or fakes. This includes but is not limited to, manual search and input from expert, consolidation of reports of the same incident and finally accept or archive incidents.

The use case ESS is convinced that the most promising way to solve an ESS incident will be a bottom-up approach. Once the Clearing Agency found that the incident\'s originator (here called: L0) is a Catena-X member, the Clearing Agency can use Catena-X Services find out the BPN-L, BPN-S and the EDC endpoints of the incident originator. Then the ESS incident is transferred to the incident originator via the Catena-X network.

In case no Catena-X member can be identified as incident originator, the clearing agency will maintain the corresponding status "no member found".

If a Catena-X member wants to find out if a certain product is affected by an incident a top-down approach can be used. The Clearing Agency can initiate an occasion-related trace if a Catena-X member is affected by an ESS incident. To do so, the BPN-S of the incident originator and the product information, that shall be investigated, can be used to find out if a Catena-X member is affected or not. A spike has been implemented by recursive IRS to test this scenario.

### 5.3 CATENA-X SERVICES - CLEARING AGENCY

The Catena-X Services will return the requested information about the Catena-X incident originator.
In case no Catena-X member can be identified, this result will be returned to the Clearing Agency.

### 5.4 CLEARING-AGENCY - CATENA-X MEMBER L0

The Clearing Agency addresses the Catena-X Member L0 via the Catena-X network and transfers all information that is available about the ESS incident.
The Clearing Agency must prepare and fill in the fields for external communication (anonymized data) for the data transfer to Catena-X Members LN.

### 5.5 CATENA-X MEMBER L0 - CATENA-X TRACE APPLICATION

The Catena-X Member L0 receives, hosts and investigates the ESS incident. The Catena-X Member L0 is responsible for defining appropriate measures about the ESS incident.

To find affected Business Partners, Catena-X Member L0 can use Catena-X trace services like recursive IRS or Knowledge Agent. So, affected customers (respectively suppliers in case of a top-down approach) and their BPN-numbers and EDC endpoints can be identified.

### 5.6 CATENA-X TRACE APPLICATION - CATENA-X MEMBER L0

Catena-X trace services like recursive IRS or Knowledge Agent will return the requested information about the Catena-X Business Partners.

## 5.7 CATENA-X MEMBER L0 - CATENA-X MEMBER L1

Catena-X Member L0 will address Catena-X Member(s) L1 via the Catena-X network.

L1 Business partners have a direct relationship with L0. As already supported in existing legislation, L1 Business partners will have access to the status of the ESS incident and full information about this incident.

## 5.8 CATENA-X MEMBER L1 - C-X Member LN

To find affected Business Partners, Catena-X Member L1 can use Catena-X trace services like recursive IRS or Knowledge Agent. So, affected customers for a bottom-up approach, respectively affected suppliers in case of a top-down approach, along with their BPN-numbers and EDC endpoints can be identified.

Catena-X Members LN have an indirect relationship with the potential incident originator L0. They will receive anonymized incident information and relevant changes about the incident (anonymized data, incident category, incident subcategory, incident status etc.).

In case of a bottom-up approach, the process moves from Business partner to Business partner up the supply chain with the incident originator as the starting point.
In case of a top-down approach, the process moves from Business partner to Business partner down the supply chain until the incident originator can be reached.

### 5.9 CATENA-X Member L0 - CLEARING AGENCY

As soon as the Catena-X member L0 has fulfilled his duties and defined measures about the ESS incident according to the agreed Code of Conduct, the incident can be closed. The Catena-X Member L0 reports to the Clearing Agency that the incident can be closed.

The Clearing Agency sets the status to closed.
