# CX-0116 Sanction Party Watchlist Dashboard v1.2.1

## ABSTRACT

Doing business with companies (and affiliates) which are sanctioned or affected by embargos can result in fines and reputational damage. However, identification of sanctioned partners is difficult due to the vast amount of different sanction lists from several countries and authorities. Even manual checks are difficult due to a lack of high-quality data provisioned by the authorities. With Sanction and Watchlist Monitoring, data synchronized with a data mirror is monitored continuously against the latest sanction and watch lists. The Sanction Party Watchlist Dashboard (SWD) has to provide a summary on potential matches. The matching against sanction and watch lists have to be activated in the company data lookup, so data maintainers are already notified during creation or update workflows. The monitoring scope has to be extended to political exposed persons (so called PEPs). SWD has to visualize the outcome of the sanction watchlist monitoring rules via a dashboard.

SWD uses the Gate API CX-0074:3.0, optional the Pool API CX-0012:4.0 based on the CX-0018:3.0 Dataspace Connectivity for pulling BP data records. SWD has to be a client/ server cloud application which contains a Web Client and a Cloud Server Application.
SWD has to contain a user and authorization management capability aligned with the CX Portal and Marketplace user management. SWD has to contain an API and has to be  available in English and German language

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

*This section is non-normative.*

This standard is relevant for the following audience:

- Catena-X certified Operational Companies acting as:
  - Core Service Provider
  - Business Application Provider
  - Data Provider and Consumer

Screening and monitoring of BP data records to global, regional or country specific Sanction Party lists and regulations is not part of the Golden Record qualification process. Therefore has to offer SWD an optional incremental service of screening BP master data of an CX Member in his Inbound Persistence. SWD has to provide results and status codes which has to enable the navigation of CX Member and Golden Record related process steps.

SWD has to be a Value Added Services Solution and has to get accessed via the CX Marketplace.

SWD MUST rely on CX-0010 Business Partner Number Version 2.0.0 or higher. The Gate API MUST be implemented as defined in CX-0074 Version 3.0.0 or higher based on the OpenAPI 3.0.1 specification or higher. Access to the Catena-X standards is available via Catena-X's standard library at https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

*This section is non-normative.*

This document is focusing on the functionality of the Sanction Party Watchlist Dashboard (SWD) which has to be a screening and monitoring tool of CX Member BP data records in the Inbound Persistence based on the following capabilities:

1. Continuously monitoring BP data records of a CX Member based on a unified rule methodology of global available sanction party watchlists

2. Individual selection of sanction party watchlists

3. Matching Score Weighting customization

4. Sanction Watchlist results by BP data record, results status code and other filter functions

5. Customizable dashboard functionalities and role and authorization management

6. SWD API functionalities for accessing SWD results

> Data Sovereignty: The SWD API allows to download sanction watchlist screening related quality results of related business partner data in a data sovereign way, because each Catena-X member has its own area of business partner data in BPDM, where private data (like customer / supplier relationships) is only visible to the Catena-X member.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

## 3 SWD API

### 3.1 API ENDPOINTS AND RESOURCES

The resources MUST use the well-known HTTP request methods for CRU(D) operations:

- POST MUST be used for create requests  
- PUT MUST be used for update requests  
- GET MUST be used for read requests  

POST MAY also be used for read requests, if input is not given by parameters but rather by an HTTP body to bypass maximum URL length. PUT MAY also be used for upsert requests (create or update) if this is required. A state (active / inactive) at each entity MUST be used for a soft delete, so that the request method DELETE SHALL NOT be used. Other HTTP request methods SHALL NOT be used, including PATCH.

Downloading data from the SDW API MUST follow a staging concept with two stages, so that consumers of the SWD API can compare what they have downloaded from the Inbound Persistence via the Gate API into the database of SWD against what kind of SWD rule result and status code was provided for each business partner data record.

### 3.2 SANCTION PARTY WATCHLIST CONTROLLER

The Sanction Party Watchlist Controller MUST allow to read (search / return) sanction party watchlist incidents status codes related to an External Identifier or BPN ID. It MUST have the following resources:

|Sanction Party Watchlist Controller Resources |Description |
| :-: | :-: |
|GET/api/swd/business partner data record with sanction party watchlist incident status codes|Returns business partner data record with sanction party watchlist incident status information array|
|GET/api/swd/BP data records |Returns business partner data record by different search parameters|
|GET/api/swd/business partner data record with sanction party workflow status|Returns workflow status by business partner data record in Filtered Business Partner List|
|GET/api/swd/shareholder natural person list by Business Partner data record|Returns first and last name of business partner data record shareholders|

### 3.3 SANCTION PARTY WATCHLIST SHARING STATE CONTROLLER

The sharing state controller MUST allow to read sharing state entries of BP data records complemented by the Sanction Party Watchlist incident status results.  The sharing state controller MUST have the following resources:

|Sharing State Resources |Description |
| :-: | :-: |
|GET/api/swd/sharing-state |Returns sharing states of business partner data record with incident status result  filtered by External Identifier, BPN ID and type, country, city and address|

### 3.4 **AVAILABLE DATA TYPES**

The API **MUST** use JSON as the payload format transported via HTTP. Other formats can be added. These are then, however, **OPTIONAL**.

### 3.5 **DATA ASSET STRUCTURE**

The following data assets **MUST** be registered at the Core Service Provider so that the Sharing Member can negotiate an API usage contract with the Core Service Provider and access its dedicated BPDM Gate (hosted by the Core Service Provider) through these data assets[^6]:

| **Name**                             | **Type** | **Version** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 3.6 **ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

#### 3.6.1 **CONVENTIONS FOR USE CASE POLICY IN CONTEXT OF DATA EXCHANGE**
  
In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.
  
For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile). This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas **MUST** be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

#### 3.6.2 **ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING ACCESS POLICIES**

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number:

- Membership
- BPNL

#### 3.6.3 **ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING USAGE POLICIES**

In the context of data usage policies (“Usage Policies”), Participants and related services **MUST** use the following policy rules:
  
- Use Case Framework (“FrameworkAgreement”)
- at least one use case purpose (“UsagePurpose”) from the above mentioned [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).
  
Additionally, respective usage policies **MAY** include the following policy rule:
  
- Reference Contract (“ContractReference”).
