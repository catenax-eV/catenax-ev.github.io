# CX-0001 Participant Agent Registration v1.2

## 1. Introduction

This standard solves a requirement towards GAIA-X compliance. It is necessary that each Participant Agent must
provide a Self Description (SD) of type `ServiceOffering`. This requires a registration of a Participant Agent
at the Core Service Provider B.

NOTE: This standard has been renamed as the original name `EDC Discovery API` is obsolete for several reasons:

1. The name `EDC` is obsolete. The correct term as defined in the [Data Space Protocol](#data-space-protocol)
   is `Participant Agent`.
2. The discovery API is a deprecated feature that is only necessary for backward compatibility reasons, connector
   discovery is from now on done using the DID document as specified in [CX-0018](#cx-0018-dataspace-connectivity).
3. Therefore, the only normative aspect of this standard left is the registration to fulfil the GAIA-X compliance
   requirements. This is reflected in the new standard name.

### 1.1 Audience & Scope

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following roles:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider
- Core Service Provider
- Onboarding Service Provider
- Enablement Service Provider

### 1.2 Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this
specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT**
in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 RFC2119, RFC8174 when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.3 Proof of conformity

All participants and their solutions will need to proof, that they are
conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are
applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies
(CABs).

- The Service Operator MUST provide an onboarding process for
  participants and participant agent instances. This has to be provided in
  accordance to
  [CX-0006](#cx-0006-registration-and-initial-onboarding)

- The implemented service MUST use an SD storage like SD-Hub for storing the SD documents
  provided during the onboarding process.

- The provided SD documents MUST be GAIA-X compliant, i.e. MUST provide a compliance credential issued
  from GAIA-X AISBL.

### 1.5 Terminology

> *This section is non-normative*

The following terms are especially relevant for the understanding of the
standard:

**Business Partner Number (BPN)**

A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-X, see [CX-0010](#cx-0010-business-partner-number).

**Self Description (SD)**

Gaia-X requires all providers to describe themselves and their service
offerings using standardized, machine-readable metadata called
Self-Descriptions. Such Self-Descriptions will for example include
information like the address of a company, a specific service
description or certificates and labels.

**Participant Agent**

A Participant Agent is a service that fulfills the requirements of the
[CX-0018 standard](#cx-0018-dataspace-connectivity)

Additional terminology used in this standard can be looked up in the
glossary on the association homepage.

## 2 Participant Agent Registration

> *This section is normative*

- The Core Service Provider B MUST offer a process/workflow to register Participant Agents; Enablement Service
  Provider as well as Application Service Provider MUST run the Participant Agent registration for their service
  customers. The provided url endpoint for the participant agent service must be in accordance to
  [CX-0018](#cx-0018-dataspace-connectivity).

- SD documents MUST be created for every Participant Agent registered by the Participants.
  The Core Service Provider B make them available.

- The self-description documents used as data source MUST be GAIA-X compliant, i.e. adhering to the
  [GAIA-X Trustframework](#gaia-x-trustframework) in the currently supported version in Catena-X. It
  MUST provide a compliance credential issued from GAIA-X AISBL.
  
- In addition, these SD documents MUST be registered at an SD storage like SD-Hub.

A test case will be, that a Participant Agent instance has to be onboarded for a
specific participant identified by a BPN. The SD for the EDC has to be
visible in the supported SD storage.

## 3.0 Backward Compatibility

> *This section is normative, it is not part of the backward compatibility requirement for this
> standard version.*

The `EDC Discovery API` service MUST be offered as central available endpoint by the Core Service Provider B.
Every Participant Agent operated in the dataspace MUST be registered. The Core Service Provider B MUST offer each
registered Participant Agent via the `EDC Discovery API`.

The `EDC Discovery API` can get triggered via technical as well as real users, if relevant roles are available.

For technical user, a company can request the user creation with the technical user creation feature inside the portal.

A test case will be, that the query against a registered participant agent instance for the given BPN
SHOULD provide the connector url as stated in the SD document which is the same as used during registration.

### 3.1 API Endpoints & resources

The `EDC Discovery API` MUST be implemented as specified here:

Endpoint: POST: `/api/administration/connectors/discovery`

**Request body**

the request body can be kept empty (to retrieve a complete list of registered Participant Agents) or be filled
with one or multiple BPNs to retrieve a list of registered Participant Agent endpoints for the giving BPNs.

```json
[
    "BPNL....",
    "BPNL...."
]
```

**Response structure**

```json
[
    {
        "bpn": "BPNL......",
        "connectorEndpoint": [
            "http://some.example.url",
            "http://some.other-example.url"
        ]
    },
    {
        "bpn": "BPNL......",
        "connectorEndpoint": "http://some.example.url"
    }
]
```

For each BPN an own response object is provided. In case of multiple Participant Agent
instances for one BPN an array is returned (first result set) otherwise
a single value (second result set)

<!-- TODO: Make the reponse more precise according to the schema: https://<hostname>/<path-to-root>/<version-path>/<dsp-endpoint> -->

### 3.2 Available Data Types

The API MUST use JSON as the payload transported via HTTP.

### 3.3 Data Asset Structure

This API is not accessed via a Participant Agent but can be
queried from any authorized participant or service directly.

### 3.4 Error Handling

HTTP standard response codes that MUST be used as described in the following table.

|     Code    |     Description                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
|     200     |     Discovery request finished successfully    |
|     400     |     Request body was malformed                 |
|     401     |     Not authorized                             |
|     403     |     Forbidden                                  |
|     405     |     Method not allowed                         |
