## ABSTRACT

The Business Partner Data Management (BPDM) is a distributed service-based system, composed of a set of dedicated services, that simultaneously serve multiple stakeholders. It is based on a central data pool of business partners, which is consistent with the overall design principles of Catena-X. The main target is to create business partner data records (such as customer/supplier) with a high quality and currentness, to provide other processes with these data. This results in less rework and adjustment due to better master data quality which ultimately leads to an overall cost reduction for participating companies. Additionally, Value Added Services shall be offered to enrich those business partner data sets even further and give additional information or warnings about the business partners. Getting a 360° view on your business partners also helps with reducing costs and achieving process excellence because better decisions can be made.

The Business Partner Gate allows any Catena-X member to share own business partner data as well as business partner data of its suppliers and customers with the Catena-X network so that cleansed and enriched business partner data records, so-called Golden Records, can be created and made available. It is a main component of the architecture framework at Catena-X, as it enables the Catena-X members to leverage accurate, complete, and consistent business partner data for Catena-X applications and shared services.

The Business Partner Gate can be accessed via the standardized API described in this standard.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following audience:

- Core Service Provider
- Onboarding Service Provider
- Data Provider and Consumer

This document focuses on the Business Partner Gate API (short: Gate API) that is part of the Business Partner Data Management (BPDM) described on the [BPDM Catena-X Website](https://catena-x.net/en/offers-standards/bpdm). It is relevant for core service providers who want to provide services for uploading and downloading business partner master data records with the aim of cleansing and enriching them and thus create a high-quality business partner data record (Golden Record), which is identified by the business partner number (BPN). It is also relevant for onboarding service providers, business application providers as well as data providers and consumers who want to use such services.

Not in scope are the structure and logic of the business partner number itself and the mechanism on how the business partner number is issued. There is a separate standard for this: CX-0010 Business Partner Number 2.0.0.

Not in scope is the overall Business Partner Data Pool with all Golden Records within Catena-X and the way of how the Golden Records can be retrieved. There is a separate standard for this: CX-0012 Business Partner Data Pool API 4.0.0.

Not in scope are the requirements of cleansing and enriching the business partner data records with the aim to create a Golden Record. There is a separate standard for this: CX-0076 Golden Record End to End Requirements Standard 1.2.0.

You can find the other standards in the standard library of Catena-X: https://catena-x.net/en/standard-library

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The Gate API is a crucial core component in Catena-X and its platform capability BPDM because it contributes to the following functions:

1. Data Consistency: The Gate API allows that data related to business partners can be collected from multiple sources and can be sent through the sharing process to correct, enrich and validate the data. This ultimately enables BPDM to create accurate, complete, and consistent business partner data records (Golden Records). This helps to reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies in business partner data.
2. Data Sovereignty: The Gate API allows to upload and download business partner data in a data sovereign way, because each Catena-X member has its own area of business partner data in BPDM, where private data (like customer / supplier relationships) is only visible to the Catena-X member.
3. Data Governance: The Gate API is the basis for a data governance framework and helps to enforce data quality standards, such as data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. It allows to compare the uploaded business partner data records against the corrected and enriched ones and provides the Sharing Member with a proposal for taking over the changes into the local MDM systems. This helps to ensure that business partner data is of high quality and can be trusted for use in various business processes.
4. Interoperability: The Gate API provides an interoperable and standardized way of uploading and downloading business partner data, ensuring both Core Service Provider interchangeability and streamlined data accessibility for all consumers of the API.

There is a reference implementation for the Gate API on GitHub. It is part of a Spring Boot Kotlin open-source software project under the hood of the Eclipse Foundation and follows the Apache 2.0 licenses.

For the complete and up-to-date API setup refer to the following website: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm

For an architecture overview refer to the ARC42 documentation: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/tree/release/6.0.x/docs/arc42

To use the Gate API in the BPDM use case apart from this standard, the following other standards should be considered by all participants for which this standard is relevant:

- CX-0018 Dataspace Connectivity 3.0.0
- CX-0012 Business Partner Data Pool API 4.0.0

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

If sections are marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in these sections are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14) [[RFC2119](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

When implementing the API defined in this standard, proof of conformity **MUST** be provided by the following deliverables:

- An OpenAPI specification defining the relevant resources for this standard
- Examples of data assets

## 1.4 EXAMPLES

The following examples show business partners which are potentially shared using this API.

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

### 1.5.1 GENERAL

**Golden Record:** Golden Record defines a business partner data record which successfully passed a set of predefined quality rules. These rules qualified the data record into a harmonized, standardized, and semantically unified data structure which is defined by Catena-X. The Golden Record status is a prerequisite for each BP data record to receive a valid BPN.

**Sharing Member:** A Sharing Member is a Catena-X member who shares the business partner data of his own business environment[^6].

**Company Data:** Company Data are business partner data that represent the organizational structures of the Sharing Member.

### 1.5.2 DATA MODEL

This chapter explains the data model[^1] from a conceptual / terminology point of view. It does not include technical details of the API data model, such as:

- differences in response and request
- differences in data stages (like input or output)
- attributes for pagination
- singular query parameters, which are not already attributes of the entities

**Note that cardinalities always refer to the entity state as required output of the sharing process. In general, cardinalities of relations and attributes are not to be enforced while uploading business partners, except for the external ID.**

#### 1.5.2.1 BUSINESS PARTNER

![Business Partner](./assets/BusinessPartner.png)

In general, a business partner is any entity (such as a customer, a supplier, an employee, or a service provider) that does business with another entity.

In Catena-X, a business partner is an organization (such as an enterprise or company, university, association, etc., and not a natural person) or one of its substructures that acts as unique partner within the automotive supply chain - either in the role of a direct participant, or a consultant, or a non-production-material (NPM) supplier.

The business partner entity in the Gate API provides a merged view on the entity combinations from the Business Partner Data Pool. In all combinations, a business partner has exactly one legal entity and one address assigned. It may additionally have a site assigned if the assigned address belongs to the site and the site is known to BPDM / has been shared by the owner. Note that for the assignment of the entities the respective BPNL, BPNS or BPNA (from the Business Partner Data Pool) are used.

The business partner address type and the BPN assignment determine the entity combinations, on which the business partner entity provides a merged view. The combinations are visualized in the following table. All other combinations are invalid as output of the sharing process and will result in a [sharing error](#1528-sharing-state-entry):

## 2 BUSINESS PARTNER GATE API \[NORMATIVE\]

The Business Partner Gate API allows to upload and download business partner data records to improve their quality and enrich them with additional information. The Gate API **MUST** be implemented based on the [OpenAPI 3.0.1 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.1.md).

### 2.1 PRECONDITIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

To run the API the following **SHOULD** be set up: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/blob/release/6.0.x/README.md

### 2.2 API SPECIFICATION

#### 2.2.1 API ENDPOINT & RESOURCES

The Gate API **MUST** be implemented as defined in the following OpenAPI document: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/release/6.0.x/docs/api/gate.json

The resources **MUST** use the well-known HTTP request methods for CRU(D) operations:

- POST method **MUST** be used for create requests
- PUT[^4] method **MUST** be used for update requests
- GET method **MUST** be used for read requests

The POST method MAY also be used for read requests, if input is not given by parameters but rather by an HTTP body to bypass maximum URL length. The PUT method MAY also be used for upsert requests (create or update) if this is required. A state (active / inactive) at each entity **MUST** be used for a soft delete, so that the DELETE method SHALL NOT be used. Other HTTP request methods SHALL NOT be used, including PATCH.

To facilitate the compliance assessment, this chapter additionally lists and describes the API resources of the Gate API per API controller.

The following API controllers of the OpenAPI document **MUST** be implemented:

- Business Partner controller
- Sharing state controller
- Changelog controller

Uploading and downloading data to/from the Gate API **MUST** follow a staging concept with two stages, so that consumers of the Gate API can compare what they have uploaded (input stage) against what has been corrected and/or enriched by BPDM (output stage). The following controllers **MUST** distinguish between an input and an output stage:

- Business Partner controller
- Changelog controller

Note that all resources of the OpenAPI document described in the following are MANDATORY. Conversely, all resources not described in the following are **OPTIONAL**.

#### 2.2.1.1 BUSINESS PARTNER CONTROLLER

The business partner controller **MUST** allow to create, update, or read business partners in the input and read from the output stage. It **MUST** have the following resources:

| **Business Partner Controller Resources** | **Description**                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PUT/input/business-partners               | Creates business partners or updates existing business partners in the input stage. |
| POST/input/business-partners/search       | Returns business partners by an array of external IDs from the input stage.         |
| POST/output/business-partners/search      | Returns business partners by an array of external IDs from the output stage.        |

#### 2.2.1.2 SHARING STATE CONTROLLER

The sharing state controller **MUST** allow to read sharing state entries of business partners. A sharing state of type "Success" **SHOULD** include the assigned BPNL, BPNS and BPNA. The sharing state controller **MUST** have the following resources:

| **Sharing State Controller Resources** | **Description**                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET/sharing-state                      | Returns sharing states of business partners, optionally filtered by an array of external IDs. |

#### 2.2.1.3 CHANGELOG CONTROLLER

The changelog controller **MUST** allow to read business partner change log entries. It **MUST** have the following resources:

| **Changelog Controller Resources**             | **Description**                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST/input/business-partners/changelog/search  | Returns change log entries as of a specified timestamp from the input stage, optionally filtered by an array of external IDs.  |
| POST/output/business-partners/changelog/search | Returns change log entries as of a specified timestamp from the output stage, optionally filtered by an array of external IDs. |

### 2.2.2 AVAILABLE DATA TYPES

The API **MUST** use JSON as the payload format transported via HTTP. Other formats can be added. These are then, however, **OPTIONAL**.

### 2.2.3 DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

The following data assets **MUST** be registered at the Core Service Provider so that the Sharing Member can negotiate an API usage contract with the Core Service Provider and access its dedicated BPDM Gate (hosted by the Core Service Provider) through these data assets[^6]:

| **Type** | **Subject**                          | **Version** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BPDMGate | FullAccessGateInputForSharingMember  | 6.0         | Grants the Sharing Member full access to the input persistence. This can be used to read business partner data in the input persistence, and create / update business partner data in the input persistence from data sources of the Sharing Member. To that end, it also grants read access to the input changelog entries.                                                      |
| BPDMGate | ReadAccessGateInputForSharingMember  | 6.0         | Grants the Sharing Member read access to the input persistence. This can be used explicitly for value-added services to read business partner data from the input persistence. To that end, it also grants read access to the input changelog entries.                                                                                                                            |
| BPDMGate | ReadAccessGateOutputForSharingMember | 6.0         | Grants the Sharing Member read access to the output persistence. This can be used to read business partner data from the output persistence so that the data sources of the Sharing Member can be updated. Furthermore, it can be used to update data sources in value-added services. To that end, it also grants read access to the output changelog and sharing state entries. |

Example data asset ([*dct:type*](https://purl.org/dc/terms/type) for asset type, [*dct:subject*](https://purl.org/dc/terms/subject) for asset subject, [*dct:description*](https://purl.org/dc/terms/description) for asset description and *cx-common:version* for asset version from the table above):

```json
{

        "proxyPath": true,
        "proxyQueryParams": true,
        "proxyBody": true
    }
}
```

The OAuth2 client permissions **MUST** be configured to solely allow access to the API resources defined in the corresponding asset, checking HTTP method (read vs. full access), path (e.g. for input / output / sharing state), query parameters and body of the HTTP request sent to the data plane public API which acts as a proxy for the BPDM Gate API[^7].

### 2.2.4 ERROR HANDLING

The following http response codes **MUST** be defined for all resources:

- 200 - OK
- 400 - Bad Request
- 401 - Unauthorized
- 403 - Forbidden
- 404 - Not Found
- 500 - Internal Server Error

HTTP Status Code Registry **MUST** be adhered to in the implementation for the decision on when to use which error code: https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml

### 2.2.5 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

#### 2.2.5.1 CONVENTIONS FOR USE CASE POLICY IN CONTEXT OF DATA EXCHANGE
  
In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.
  
For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile). This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas **MUST** be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

#### 2.2.5.2 ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING ACCESS POLICIES

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number.

- Membership
- BPNL

#### 2.2.5.3 ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING USAGE POLICIES

In the context of data usage policies (“Usage Policies”), Participants and related services **MUST** use the following policy rules:
  
- Use Case Framework (“FrameworkAgreement”)
- at least one use case purpose (“UsagePurpose”) from the above mentioned [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).
  
Additionally, respective usage policies **MAY** include the following policy rule:
  
- Reference Contract (“ContractReference”).
  
Details on  namespaces and ODRL policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

## ANNEXES

### FIGURES

> *This section is non-normative*

The following picture shows the business partner with the business partner relationship as an outlook for one of the next versions of this standard:

![Business Partner with Relationship](./assets/BusinessPartnerWithRelationship.png)

The idea is to use the business partner relationship to upload different kinds of relations between two business partners, such as:

- a business partner is the legal entity for another business partner
- a business partner is replaced by another business partner

It is not intended to use the business partner relationship for legal hierarchies (majority shareholding).

### TABLES

> *This section is non-normative*

Intentionally left blank.

[^1]: Note that PlantUml is used for the conceptual UML diagrams in this document (A = abstract class; green E = entity; C = class; red E = enumeration). An abstract class has no actual representation in the OpenAPI implementation. An entity is usually implemented by an own OpenAPI controller with resources and usually is the root in a payload, while a class is a sub node in the payload. An enumeration is a set of predefined values.

[^2]: Note that each data record in the MDM business partner data of the Sharing Member does not explicitly have to be flagged as "is own company data". However, it is important that the Sharing Member flags business partners as "is own company data" in the initial upload of own Company Data, such as by introducing a constant in the used middleware.

[^3]: Note that this a currently a soft-delete approach and not a business state. However, this can be adapted in the next version of this standard.

[^4]: Note that in case of a PUT the corresponding resources expect to receive the full updated record, including values that did not change.

[^5]: Note that there is currently a debate as to whether a site is only a consolidation of addresses (BPNA), with all addresses being equally ranked, since a "main" address can't always be defined at this point in time. This may lead to changes in the next update of this standard.

[^6]: Note that the Sharing Member assumes the roles Data Provider on upload and Data Consumer on download of business partner data, while the Core Service Provider assumes the roles Data Consumer on upload and Data Provider on download of business partner data.

[^7]: Note that the definition of the data assets depends on the current implementation state of the reference implementation (Tractus-X Eclipse Dataspace Connector). Therefore the data assets represent permissions on APIs, whereas they should actually only represent APIs.
