# CX-0123 Quality Use Case Standard v2.0.0

## ABSTRACT

The Catena-X use case "Quality" provides the ability to detect
quality issues the earliest possible to start root cause analyses and/or to enable
an early warning feature for new quality topics. In subsequent steps, counter
measures can also be defined earlier and monitored. In sum, this reduces the
number of vehicles affected by quality issues and increases the availability of the
vehicle and built-in components. Catena-X use case "Quality" is powered
by Catena-X standard core components to share data from OEM and suppliers
based on data sharing agreements and usage policies.

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

```text
  See section Audience & Scope
```

## COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE STANDARD

Changes compared to V1.0.0 of CX-0123:

- Update semantic models QualityTask, PartsAnalyses, ManufacturedPartsQInformation, Fleet.DiagnosticData, Fleet.ClaimData
- Update model Fleet.Vehicles and integrate model Vehicle.ProductDescription
- New semantic models Early Warning Norification and Failure Pattern
- Update 2.1 Data Sharing Rules
- Define Notification Process and API

## 1 INTRODUCTION

The Catena-X use case "Quality" uses multiple data models to
exchange data between automotive manufacturer (OEM) and component supplier
(TIER 1) and also along the supply chain betwwen TIER N and TIER N + 1. Each of these data models can be supplied independently.
The QualityTask data model defines the root element for Catena-X-based quality
work. It describes the quality task and why two companies want to work
collaboratively on a quality topic.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

The standard is relevant for the following roles within the scope of the Use Case "Quality"

- Data Provider/Consumer
- Business Application Provider

In scope:

- Data sharing between OEM, TIER 1 and TIER N
- Earliest possible detection of potential issues with products and vehicles in usage
- Understanding of the root cause of the detected issues to enable earliest possible counter measure implementation and monitoring the effectiveness

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

For all participants of the Use Case "Quality" it is necessary to provide and consume the data in accordance to the standardized semantic data models in section [3 Aspect Models](#3-aspect-models) to ensure the defined interoperability requirement "free of choice application" to be able to use the established inhouse tool set for analysis.

Catena-X use case "Quality" data flow: Data is exported from existing backend systems and mapped to Catena-X aspect models - see list of relevant Catena-X aspect models for use case "Quality" in section [3 Aspect Models](#3-aspect-models)
The so generated files are transferred between different Catena-X participants using a connector conformant to [CX-0018].

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**
and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards.
To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

Since this Use Case Quality Standard describes a set of standards to be fulfilled, participants MUST fulfill all
mentioned standards and the respective conformity assessment criteria in addition to the specific criteria mentioned in
this document.

The specific criteria described in this document are describing the usage of the central tools as well as common tools
described in the linked standardization documents and therefore compliance **SHOULD BE** checked with the tools provided
for these components.

### 1.4 EXAMPLES

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

Business Partner Number (BPN)
: A BPN is the unique identifier of a partner within Catena-x

Connector conformant to [CX-0018]
: The e.g. Tractus-X EDC is a reference implementation of a connector for IDSA conform sovereign data exchange

Additional terminology used in this standard can be looked up in the glossary on the association homepage.

#### 2.1.3 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

```text
Data exchange between the participating partner companies is necessarily to be done for large vehicle and product populations. The data exchange therefore should be done as a file download via EDC according to the following specifications.

**Asset File type**
It is recommended to create and transfer the files in the type parquet. Exceptions:
- Attachments for the Quality task (Quality Task Attachment) should be created in ZIP format
- Failure Pattern should be transferred in JSON format

**Asset Transfers via EDC**
File transfer is recommended to be done via EDC S3 plane, The transfer via EDC http data plane is not recommended due to the big data size.
As separator between element names and properties "_" has to be used.

**S3 Data Address**
These properties are not use-case specific

In the Quality Use-Case, this is identified as `https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#QualityAsset`. The expected payload this API serves is determined by the `dcat:conformsTo` property.                                                                                                            |

**Asset consumption**
The data provided in the asset is build from at least one of 4 to 6 structures. To assure a secure and 
smooth exchange flattening rules for the file (csv / xls / Parquet / json) must be applied. This includes checks for format and possible values for each column. If the rules are not applied correctly the mapping of content will not be possible without manual handling effort:

- Separator
As separator between element names "_" has to be used.

- Handling of "null values"
Only unique identifier properties (like VAN, serial number, ....) are set to mandatory and all other properties are set to optional. E.g.: If a car has no mileage value after a diagnostic session this property would be left empty.

- File flattening rules:
To flatten a hierarchical structure into ONE table for data providing the cross-product has to be used: 
Beginning from root entity: Do a left outer join with all children one level down. Than for every children that also has child entities: Do a left out join with all child entities one level down.
```

Conventions for Use Case Policy in context data exchange

In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.

For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed ODRL policy repository. This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas MUST be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

Additional Details regarding Access Policies

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number:

- Membership
- BPNL

Additional Details regarding Usage Policies

In the context of data usage policies (“Usage Policies”), Participants and related services MUST use the following policy rules:

- Use Case Framework (“FrameworkAgreement”) at least one use case purpose (“UsagePurpose”) from the above mentioned ODRL policy repository.

Additionally, respective usage policies MAY include the following policy rule:

- Reference Contract (“ContractReference”).

Details on namespaces and ODRL policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the ODRL policy repository.

#### 2.1.4 DIGITAL TWINS AND SPECIFIC ASSET IDs

## 3 ASPECT MODELS

### 3.1 ASPECT MODEL "QUALITY TASK"

#### 3.1.1 INTRODUCTION

The "Quality Task" data model is the root element for Catena-X-based quality work. It is a model that can be created by the automotive manufacturer or by the supplier and describes why data is exchanged over Catena-X network between two companies, who are the responsible people in each company and what should happen with transferred data after the completion of a "Quality Task".

For data providers:
Each "Quality Task" **MUST** have a unique qualityTaskId conformant to the semantic model.

#### 3.1.2 SPECIFICATIONS ARTIFACTS

This aspect model is written in SAMM 2.1.0 as a modeling language conformant to CX-0003
  
Like all Catena-X data models, this model is available in a machine-readable format on GitHub
conformant to CX-0003.

### 3.9 ASPECT MODEL "FAILURE PATTERN"

#### 3.9.1 INTRODUCTION

The Failure Pattern data model provides the option to identify one specific hardware or software failure in a vehicle, system or product based on a data signature without analysing the faulty hardware.
The utilisation of a failure pattern is divided into two phases. In a first step, the pattern must be derived. Unique identified root causes from e.g. physical analyses of products serve as a database.
Data in a temporal context, such as failure codes from electronic control units, are analysed using e.g. machine learning algorithms.
Afterwards data patterns are derived that differentiate between the occurrence and non-occurrence of an error. Failure patterns can then be used to check e.g. the effectiveness of quality measures.

## 4 APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

> *This section is normantive*

### 4.1 NOTIFICATION API

Notifications are - in contrast to classical data offers in Catena-X - a way to push data from a sender to a receiver. For now, this notification API is limited to the sending and receiving of early warning notifications as well as the update of the notification status (following a predefined [State Model](#5121-notification-state-model)).

The API is used as part of the notification process of quality management. It is important to note that this API is designed such that it is based on and extends the QUALITY NOTIFICATION API defined in [CX - 0125 TRACEABILITY USE CASE]. Both may be merged in a future version.

In this regard it is important to mention, that the API standardized here is not a central API, but an API to be implemented into each participant's quality or traceability solution or solution stack in order to be able to receive information related to early warning and/or quality issues and notifications in the first place.

So, this chapter describes this early warning notification API with its relevant API endpoints to be created by each supporting quality or traceability solution or solution stack and their integration into the IDSA Protocol and/or the Tractus-X EDC as a reference implementation. On top this chapter describes the Data Asset Structure within the participant who wants to be able to receive notifications and/or updates to notifications. As the notification process includes bi-directional status communication, both entities in a process **MUST** provide these Data Assets and a linkage to corresponding APIs. Furthermore there is also a description of the payload of the notifications for early warning.

#### 4.1.1 PRECONDITIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

Application providers **MUST** prove their conformity by providing:

- An openAPI specification of the endpoints described.
- Examples of the data asset and contract definition structure in their Tractus-X EDC or any other CX-0018 compliant connector.

The Early Warning Notification API **MUST** be published towards the network using a Data Asset/Contract Definition in terms of the IDSA Protocol as described by the reference implementation [CX - 0018 DATASPACE CONNECTIVITY].

The Tractus-X EDC as a reference implementation **SHOULD** BE used and is referenced in this document. Other connectors fulfilling the same standards towards Catena-X **MAY** be leveraged as well.

It is of importance to mention, that there **MUST** be an API available behind each of the data offers described in the Tractus-X EDC, which works according to the openAPI specifications description.

Nevertheless, the APIs are **OPTIONAL** to follow the same structure, as there could even be APIs taking over the job of several of the endpoints mentioned.

The Tractus-X EDC **SHOULD** act as a reverse proxy towards those APIs, as it holds the Data Offers linked to the respective implemented endpoints.

#### 4.1.2 API SPECIFICATION

##### 4.1.2.1 API-ENDPOINTS

The quality notification API **MUST** be implemented as specified in the [openAPI](https://github.com/catenax-eV/product-standardization-prod/blob/main/standards/CX-0123-QuallityUseCaseStandard/2.0.0/src/earlywarningnotification-1-0-0.yaml) documentation.

In fact, it is **OPTIONAL** to implement the endpoint paths exactly as described in the [openAPI](https://github.com/catenax-eV/product-standardization-prod/blob/main/standards/CX-0123-QuallityUseCaseStandard/2.0.0/src/earlywarningnotification-1-0-0.yaml)). The reason is that those endpoints are not called from any supply chain partner directly. Rather, they are called from the Tractus-X EDC as part of data assets. In that sense, it is just important to implement endpoints that can process the defined request body and respond with the HTTP status codes and - if required - reply with the defined response body.

The data assets will act similar to a reverse proxy for the notification endpoints, therefore rather the data assets are of significance, which **SHOULD** be exposed towards Catena-X through the Data Offer Catalogues in the Tractus-X EDC or any other CX-0018 compliant connector.

##### 4.1.2.2 AVAILABLE DATA TYPES

The quality notification API **MUST** use JSON as the payload transported via HTTP.

##### 4.1.2.3 API RESOURCES & ENDPOINTS

The HTTP POST endpoints introduced in this standard **MUST** be called via Data Space Protocol.

The sending and receiving of notifications **MUST** be built on the basis of HTTP POST endpoints.

#### 4.1.3 DATA ASSET STRUCTURE

##### 4.1.3.1 DATA ASSET FOR NOTIFICATION RECEIVE ENDPOINT FOR EARLY WARNING NOTIFICATION RECEIPT

When using the Tractus-X EDC, the following asset **MUST** be registered. Other connectors implementing the IDSA Protocol require a similar data asset with the same structure and provisioning towards Catena-X.

```json  
{
  "@context": {
      "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#",
      "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",
      "dct": "https://purl.org/dc/terms/"
  },
  "@type": "Asset",
  "@id": "earlywarningnotificationnotification-receive",
  "properties": {
      "dct:type": {
          "@id": "cx-taxo:ReceiveEarlyWarningNotification"
      },
      "cx-common:version": "1.2"
  },
  "dataAddress": {
      ...
  }
}  
```

The variable \{\{httpServerWhichOffersTheHttpEndpoint\}\} **MUST** be set to the HTTP server that offers the endpoint. The path /qualityinvestigations/receive **MAY** align with the HTTP POST path as stated in Section 4.1.2.1. In that sense it can change dependent on the quality or traceability application.

##### 4.1.3.2 DATA ASSET FOR NOTIFICATION UPDATE ENDPOINT FOR EARLY WARNING NOTIFICATION UPDATE

When using the Tractus-X EDC the following asset **MUST** be registered. Other connectors implementing the IDSA Protocol require a similar data asset with the same structure and provisioning towards Catena-X.

```json
{
  "@context": {
      "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#",
      "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",
      "dct": "https://purl.org/dc/terms/"
  },
  "@type": "Asset",
  "@id": "earlywarningnotification-update",
  "properties": {
      "dct:type": {
          "@id": "cx-taxo:UpdateEarlyWarningNotification"
      },
      "cx-common:version": "1.2"
  },
  "dataAddress": {
      ...
  }
}   
```

The variable \{\{httpServerWhichOffersTheHttpEndpoint\}\} **MUST** be set to the HTTP server that offers the endpoint. The path /qualityinvestigations/update **MAY** align with the HTTP POST path as stated in Section 4.1.2.1. In that sense it can change dependent on the quality or traceability application.

### 4.1.4 VERSIONING

The API version described in this standard document **MUST** be published in the property https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#version as version 2.0 in dcat:Dataset (http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#).

### 4.1.5 EXAMPLES

Example 1: Early Warning Notification

```text
I as a partner in an Early Warning project discover a potential quality issue while analysing the common quality data set that was exchanged previously. I want to inform my partner to perform a verfication on his side and want to communicate this data securely and sovereign to him.
```

## 5 PROCESSES

> *This section is normantive*

### 5.1 NOTIFICATION PROCESS

This chapter describes the minimum requirements for the notification process and does not go beyond the sending and receiving of early warning notifications. It also illustrates common practices for identifying the correct receiving endpoint when sending a notification. For this purpose, a protocol is described that will be exchanged between quality applications or application
stacks leveraging Tractus-X EDC or any other CX-0018 compliant connector on both ends.

The notification process therefore takes place between quality or traceability applications or application stacks, and the focus is on minimal interaction, which **MUST** be supported by all applications participating in an early warning notification scenario.

Application internals like user journeys, process steps or workflows in an application are not standardized within Catena-X, and therefore omitted.

Note that the process described here is same as the one described for Quality Notification defined in [CX - 0125 TRACEABILITY USE CASE]

#### 5.1.1 ACTORS AND ROLES

Catena-X does not standardize user-roles at the moment. The actors are quality applications of the companies in a supply chain.

#### 5.1.2 PROCESS REPRESENTATION

The exchange of notifications follows the IDSA protocol.

On top, a notification state model has been described.

##### 5.1.2.1 NOTIFICATION STATE MODEL

The notification itself has various states. The states and their cycle are described in the following figure:

![CX0125_Notification-State-Model.png](./assets/CX0125_Notification-State-Model.png)

***Figure 1: Description of Process***

The state of a notification MUST be exchanged via the [4.1. EARLY WARNING Notification API](#41-notification-api).

##### 5.1.2.2 PROCESSES FOR SENDING AND UPDATING EARLY WARNING NOTIFICATIONS

Below the sequence for sending and updating of notifications
between (quality or traceability) applications is shown in UML sequence diagrams
In all cases, HTTP POST requests **MUST** be used. The corresponding HTTP
endpoints are described in chapter [4.1 EARLY WARNING Notification API](#41-notification-api).

To read the UML sequence diagrams correctly, some remarks below:

- The shown Notification Tractus-X EDC Adapter is **OPTIONAL**. It is just one
  option to send a notification via the Tractus-X EDC control and data plane. It
  is important, that a similar functionality **MUST** be
  provided/implemented by the (quality or traceability) application vendor. The
  Notification Tractus-X EDC Adapter or a similar component / functionality will
  not be provided as a central service from Catena-X.

- To discover where a notification **MUST** be sent to, the (quality or traceability)
  application **MUST** resolve the BPN of the receiver. This can either
  happen through the (quality or traceability) application holding this
  information in its data model, or it could - alternatively - also be
  resolved e.g. via a lookup of the digital twin in the central asset
  administration shell (AAS) registry or by using services from the
