## ABSTRACT

![image](./assets/299394830-48b494f3-1b8e-4cf2-8c33-62c249f24eff.png)

- In view of the fact that Catena-X cannot manage Natural Persons it has to be secured that no Natural Person by accident may be processed or later stored in the pool.

![image](./assets/299395649-448eb834-071d-4dbb-8c1c-f36af2308f08.png)

- For historical reasons, companies often have no knowledge of whether the stored Business Partner master record contains a Natural Person. For example, there is a way to change this master record as Natural Person, but this has often not been done consistently in the past.

- In addition, the companies themselves need knowledge of Natural Persons in their systems to comply with GDPR requirements.

The Natural Person Screening application contains rules which secure with a high probability to identify Natural Person data records. The results of the rules can be visualized via a dashboard or consumed via logfiles as well as downloaded via an API. NPS uses the Gate API CX-0074_v3.0.0 and the Pool API CX-0012_v4.0.0 based on the CX-0018 Data Space Connectivity 3.0.0 for pulling BP data records.
NPS is a client/ server cloud application which contains a Web Client and a Cloud Servicer Application.
NPS has to contain a user and authorization management capability aligned with the CX Portal and Marketplace user management. NPS has to be available in English and German language.

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

The standard enables software and service companies to develop business partner master data quality dashboard applications including accessibility of external 3^rd^ party data sources.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following audience:

- Catena-X certified Operational Companies acting as:
  - Core Service Provider

This document is focusing on the functionality of the Natural Person Screening Dashboard (NPS) as a screening and monitoring tool of the Golden Record process. NPS rules focus on the analysis of the BP data records on a syntactical and partially semantical content basis. NPS will not focus on correcting or enriching data attributes services. Those services are part of the Golden Record Process.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

The Natural Person Screening Dashboard is a screening tool and methodology to identify automated with a high probability if a BP data record in the Inbound Persistence is a Natural Person or a Legal Entity. The results of the validation have to be provided via a dashboard.

The description of the required Gate API CX-0074, Version 3.0.0 is accessible throug the standard library of Catena-X: https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library

> Data Sovereignty: The NPS API allows to download natural person screening related quality results of related business partner data in a data sovereign way, because each Catena-X member has its own area of business partner data in BPDM, where private data (like customer / supplier relationships) is only visible to the Catena-X member.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

*This section is non-normative.*

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The keywords **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants will need to prove that their solutions conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

To prove conformity with the standard, verify your implementation aligns with the following sharing controller.

### 1.5 TERMINOLOGY

> *This section is non-normative*

**Natural Person**
A Natural Person is a person that is an individual human being.

**Legal Person**
A Legal Person is a Legal Entity as defined in CX-0010.

The Natural Person Screening Dashboard (NPS) has to rely on a set of clearly defined screening rules which are the basis the validate if a Business Partner (BP) is a Natural Person or a Legal Entity. NPS has to capture at least 112 countries based on ISO 3166-1. NPS has to validate BP data records in the Inbound Persistence of the related CX Member who licensed NPS. Each NPS rule has to validate defined attributes of the BP data record via a specific rule set. The architecture of NPS has to based on an exclusion methodology. The outcome of NPS has to provide results if a BP data record is a Natural Person, a Legal Entity or an undefined, unknown or unable to locate person based on the data content and quality provided.

The outcome of the main NPS rule methodologies are described below:

### 1.6 Identifier Check

NPS has to validate if the BP data record in the Inbound Persistence is already a valid
Golden Record data record with a valid BPN ID.

### 1.7 Locality Check

NPS has to validate the locality of the BP data record as a basis for further screening methodologies.

### 1.8  IdentificationÂ Check

NPS has to validate the given Identifier about their formal correctness and use the content of the Identifier via the NPS rule set to identify a Legal or a Non-Legal Entity.

### 1.9 Check via External Data Sources

NPS has to match BP data entries with appropriate global data sources to identify Natural Persons or Legal Entities.

### 1.10 Legal Form Check

NPS has to validate any Legal Form indicators of the BP data record against country specific company and institutional valid organizational forms.

### 1.11 Final Natural Person Identifier Check

NPS has to validate the BP data records against Natural Person Identifiers on a global basis.

### 1.12 Inbound Persistence

The Inbound Persistence contains the BP data records which were send by a CX Member for
validation and screening via the Gate API as defined in CX-0074 Version 3.0.0.

## 2 MAIN CONTENT

> *This section is normative*

NPS has to be a Value Added Services (VAS) application for Data Provider and Consumer to screen all BP data records in the Inbound Persistence to find a Natural Person data record.

## 3.0 NPS API

### 3.1 NPS Architecture

![image](https://github.com/catenax-eV/product-standardization-prod/assets/135617737/52f861d1-8c55-42de-9ad4-043c012e85cf)

The NPS Architecure defines the usage of the NPS API. It secures the intercommuncation between a user and the NPS application to i.e. consume the NPS results out of the NPS logfile.

### 3.2 API Endpoints and Resources

The resources MUST use the well-known HTTP request methods for CRU(D) operations:

- POST MUST be used for create requests
- PUT MUST be used for update requests
- GET MUST be used for read requests

POST MAY also be used for read requests, if input is not given by parameters but rather by an HTTP body to bypass maximum URL length. PUT MAY also be used for upsert requests (create or update) if this is required. A state (active / inactive) at each entity MUST be used for a soft delete, so that the request method DELETE SHALL NOT be used. Other HTTP request methods SHALL NOT be used, including PATCH.

Uploading and downloading data to/from the NPS API MUST follow a staging concept with two stages, so that consumers of the NPS API can compare what they have uploaded into the input stage against what kind of NPS rule results and status code was provided for each business partner data in the output stage. The following controllers MUST distinguish between an input and an output stage.

### 3.3 NPS Data Model

The NPS data model as detailed in the Annex chapter defines all Business Partner data attributes which are needed that NPS can perform the defined screening rules. Furthermore it contains all attributes the NPS dashboard requires to publish the NPS screening results.

### 3.4 Natural Person Controller

The natural person controller MUST allow to create, update, or read (search / return) business partner data records related to an External Identifier or BPN ID in the input and output stage. It MUST have the following resources:

| Business partner Data Controller ResourcesÂ  |  DescriptionÂ Â |
| - | - |
|  PUT/api/nps/input/business partner dataÂ     |  Creates business partner data record or updates existing business partner data record in the input stage. |
| GET/api/nps/output/business partner record  | Returns business partner data record from the output stage by different search parameters.Â |
|  GET/api/nps/input/business partner records  |  Returns business partner data record by different search parameters from the input stage.Â |

### 3.5 Natural Person Sharing State Controller

The sharing state controller MUST allow to create, update, or read sharing state entries of business partner data records.Â  The sharing state controller MUST have the following resources:

|  Sharing State ResourcesÂ |            DescriptionÂ |
| - | - |
| GET/api/nps/sharing-stateÂ | Returns sharing states of business partner data filtered by natural person flag, legal name, legal form, External Identifier, address, BPN ID and type, country and status codeÂ |
| PUT/api/nps/sharing-stateÂ |          Creates or updates a sharing state of a business partner data recordÂ |

Each NPS rule creates results which can get accessed via a NPS changlog containing defined status codes by rule

### 3.6 **Available Data Types**

The API **MUST** use JSON as the payload format transported via HTTP.Â Other formats can be added. These are then, however, **OPTIONAL**.

### 3.7 **Data Asset Structure**

The following data assets **MUST** be registered at the Core Service Provider so that the Sharing Member can negotiate an API usage contract with the Core Service Provider and access its dedicated BPDM Gate (hosted by the Core Service Provider) through these data assets[^6]:

| **Name**                             | **Type** | **Version** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FullAccessNPSInputOutputForSharingMember  | NPS | 1.0         | Grants the Sharing Member full access to the NPS Admin function, NPS database and NPS changelog. This can be used to read business partner NPS rule status in the NPS changelog,  create / update NPS admin settings by Sharing Member role by NPS function, activate and deactivate the usage of external data sourves via defined APIs and license keys. |
| ReadAccessNPSOutputForSharingMember  | NPS | 1.0         | Grants the Sharing Member read access of the NPS changelog.                                                                                                                         |
The OAuth2 client permissions **MUST** be configured to solely allow access to the API resources defined in the corresponding asset, checking HTTP method (read vs. full access), path, query parameters and body of the HTTP request.

### 3.8 **ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

#### 3.8.1 **CONVENTIONS FOR USE CASE POLICY IN CONTEXT OF DATA EXCHANGE**
  
In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.
  
For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile). This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas **MUST** be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

#### 3.8.2 **ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING ACCESS POLICIES**

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number:

- Membership
- BPNL

#### 3.8.3 **ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING USAGE POLICIES**

In the context of data usage policies (âUsage Policiesâ), Participants and related services **MUST** use the following policy rules:
  
- Use Case Framework (âFrameworkAgreementâ)
- at least one use case purpose (âUsagePurposeâ) from the above mentioned [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).
  
Additionally, respective usage policies **MAY** include the following policy rule:
  
- Reference Contract (âContractReferenceâ).
  
Details on  namespaces and ODRL policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

### **3.9 ERROR HANDLING**

The following http response codes MUST be defined for all resources:Â Â 

- 200 â OKÂ Â 
- 400 â Bad Request
- 401 â Unauthorized
- 403 â Forbidden
- 404 â Not FoundÂ Â 
- 500 â Internal Server Error
