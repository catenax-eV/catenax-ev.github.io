| CX-0156 | Geometry                             | 1.0.0   | The Geometry Standard defines a common framework for the interoperable exchange and use of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) data within the Catena-X ecosystem. It establishes unified standard that enable seamless integration of CAD models, mesh data, point clouds, and related spatial information from design, manufacturing, scans, or spatial metadata across diverse systems and organisations. By ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and sovereignty, the standard fosters trust, reduces integration costs, and accelerates innovation. This document provides the basis for reliable and secure 3D data handling across supply chain partners, supporting efficiency, transparency, and scalability in industrial applications. |
