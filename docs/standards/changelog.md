The Data can be delivered only to a specific Use Case within Catena-X, realised in an certified Business Application. By this way the Standard enables Third-Party Information Provider to deliver Data from outside Catena-X inside Catena-X and at the same time limits Data Delivery to existing Use Cases, avoiding Violations or Bypasses of existing Standards and Regulations within Catena-X.   |

#### Resiliency

| CX-Nr.  | Standard Name | Version |  Management Summary |
|-----------|-----------|:-----------:|--------------------|
| CX-0115 | Manufacturing Capability Exchange |  1.0    | Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) scenarios focus on connecting buyers looking for manufacturers in possession of the available production know-how and resources to produce specific products. The standard makes use of the newly introduced all-in-one use-case template. The Manufacturing Capability data model is being expanded to include the entities Machine, Tool, and Material, along with their corresponding properties. Additionally, an API is defined, so that these Manufacturing Capabilities can be exchanged in a standardized way.  <br />*Note*: The CX-0115 standard obsoletes CX-0052 Manufacturing Capability Aspect Mode l v1.0.0 |

| CX-0133 | Online Control and Simulation  | 2.1   | <ul><li>Updated references to new versions</li><li>Providers must ensure BPNL provisioning to OSim</li></ul>  |
| CX-0142 | Shop-Floor-Information-Service  | 1.0   |  The current version of the standard provides two different kinds of data: Production Forecasting, and Production Tracking data. To give an example of forecasting data, suppose a customer wants to know when production is expected to start. He can use the Shop-Floor-Information-Service in order to get the information either directly, via cyclic messages or via notifications when the calculated production dates change. As an example of production tracking, a customer can request certain production attributes collected during production, such as the torque of a particular process step. This data can then be used for both documentation and tracking. <br />*Note*: This standard <ul> <li>Merges CX-0068, CX-0069 and CX0075 by combining the different standards that describe the data model, the API and and the process into this combined standard.</li><li>Additional functionality added: production tracking aspects.</li><li>Update of Production Forecast Models due to update of CX-header.</li></ul>  |
| CX-0145 | Days of supply Exchange  | 1.0     | Days of Supply (DoS) in logistics is a critical metric used to estimate how long current inventory levels will last under normal consumption patterns. This calculation is essential in supply chain management as it assists in forecasting when stock replenishment is needed, thereby preventing stock shortages or overstocking. It plays a significant role in ensuring efficient inventory turnover, maintaining a balance between having enough stock to meet demand and avoiding excess inventory that ties up capital. To effectively address the challenges associated with manual calculation and estimation of Days of Supply, the standardization and interoperable exchange of this data among Catena-X business partners is essential. Establishing a standardized semantic definition to describe Days of Supply and a common API is a fundamental step to enable this exchange and foster compatibility. This approach maximizes the range of solutions available to mitigate potential supply shortages and supports precise inventory planning.   |
| CX-0146 | Supply Chain Disruption Notifications  | 1.0  | The Catena-X Supply Chain Disruption Notifications Standard is created for all members of the automotive supply chain. The aim is to have a functionality to easily and quickly inform the affected supply chain partners in case of supply chain disruptions at some point in the value chain. Having this information is key to be able to take the right countermeasures and make the whole value chain more resilient. Recent incidents (e.g. semi-conductor-crisis or COVID pandemic) have demonstrated the requirement for such a fast standardized process among all partners.  |
