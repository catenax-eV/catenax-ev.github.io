# CX-0131 Circularity Core v1.1.0

## ABSTRACT

This standards concludes the [Circularity KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Circularity_KIT/page-adoption-view/) and shall empower stakeholders to transition towards a circular economy by providing frameworks, guidelines and best practices to enhance sustainability credentials, enable data-driven decision-making and foster collaboration and innovation in the automotive industry.
Secondary Material Content (SMC), Material Accounting (MA), End-of-Life (EoL) and Dismantling Services, and the CE-Assistant are the four focus topics that form the first version of the Circularity KIT. The offered content and artifacts address important use cases such as sustainable material management, waste minimization and resource efficiency, that contribute to more sustainable and circular automotive value loops.
The overarching goals are:

- Establish an understanding of requirements along circular value chains and how businesses can profit by implementing  sustainable solutions
- Offer standards and guidelines for industry stakeholders
- Create the basis for data exchange and applications to ensure the provided frameworks are used in the intended way
- Explain different circularity topics and provide tools to implement them

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Within Circular Economy (CE) it is of utmost importance that any of the partners in the supply chain work closely together and share relevant information that they can provide. Due to the loops in the supply chain the role allocation of suppliers and customers is not as clear as in linear economy. Therefore, it is crucial within Circular Economy to understand the processes, conditions, connections, transitions, and temporal aspects of materials, parts, and vehicles. This involves navigating the complexities of End-of-Life (EoL) considerations, CE-Assistant, Material Accounting (MA), and Secondary Material Content (SMC). Efficiently managing resources and strategically addressing end-of-life phases are integral to fostering sustainability in a closed-loop system.

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

*This section is non-normative*

List for which roles the standard is relevant:

- Data Provider / Consumer
- Business Application Provider

The standard is of interest to all members of the automotive supply chain including suppliers, OEMs, dismantlers, recyclers and stakeholders within the recycling industry and the CE.

Additionally, the standards also apply to software providers and core service providers to ensure interoperability and data sovereignty between different core service providers. The scope of this document is to provide guidance about the different standards in the Circularity use case.

### 1.2 CONTEXT

In order to effectively enhance circularity along the supply chain, standardized approaches to different aspects of circular economy are essential. This covers the usage of SMC, MA, the CE-Assistant as well as the complexities of EoL Services. The standardization provides structured frameworks based on which information can be shared across industries and stakeholders. Therefore, it enhances comparability between companies and, by reducing the chance of misunderstandings, increases data quality.

In the EoL the issuence of a `Certificate of Decommissioning` (CoDM) by an authorized dismantling company classifies a vehicle and all associated components as EoL. The issuance of the certificate is exclusively handled by a company within Catena-X holding the CX-verifiable credential `Dismantler`. Therefore, the CoDM consistently marks the end of the initial life cycle phase of an asset, initiating the EoL process. Subsequently, additional certificates provide the opportunity to commence the start of a component's second or n-th life. However, a vehicle with a specific VIN is unequivocally designated as EoL. The End-of-Life-Vehicle (ELV) will be consecutive dismantled.

The CE-Assistant can then be used to support the dismantling company in its decision as to which components of the ELV should be reused, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled. The assistant suggests the most environmental friendly R-strategy for the components. The asset/part/component/material/fluid/etc. must be certified - reuse, repair, remanufacturing, refurbishment, material recycling, waste - in accordance with the decision made by the stakeholder of concern. This certification makes it possible to track the life cycle of the components precisely. It also offers the advantage of being able to keep statistics on what percentage of its components have been allocated to which R-strategy. In the evaluation of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of different components and their subsequent integration into the digital twin (DT), the precise categorization of these component's across different life cycle phases is a central factor.

The utilization of precisely defined EoL certificates enables the accurate determination of a components current life cycle phase. This precision not only ensures a reliable assessment, but also facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact and carbon footprint of the components, seamlessly integrating this valuable information into the digital twin framework. The dismantling process is carried out in accordance with all legal requirements (e.g. documentation of pollutant removal, etc.). The vehicle is then dismantled and individual materials are separated.

The separated assets are part of further processing by any R-strategy. The second life of the asset might for example be Reuse, Repair, Remanufacture or Recycle. Depending on the exact R-Strategy, different data might be interesting for the second life of the asset.

MA provides standardized scrap/waste and secondary material data exchange for the ecosystem partners to create transparency about recycling activities and verifiable closed loops.

To close the loops and to understand the usage of the materials provided through the previous steps, SMC explores ways to incorporate secondary materials into the value chain. By facilitating a standardized data model for data exchange and introducing a calculation methodology, this framework establishes a foundation to facilitate communication between stakeholders. Through this, the secondary materials are being brought back into the loop.
Those materials are processed into new products and after entering the EoL-phase the loop is closed.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.
The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.4 PROOF OF CONFORMITY

All participants and their solutions will need to proof, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). Please refer to the [certification information page](https://catena-x.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/certification) for the process of conformity assessment and certification. Since this Core document describes a set of standards to be fulfilled, participants **MUST** fulfill all mentioned standards for the relevant sub-usecase ([2.3](#23-secondary-material-content), [2.4](#24-eol-services), [2.5](#25-ce-assistant)) and the respective conformity assessment criteria in addition to the specific criteria mentioned in this document. The specific criteria described in this document are describing the usage of the central tools as well as common tools described in the linked standardization documents and therefore compliance should be checked with the tools provided for these components.

## 3 ASPECT MODELS

> *This section is normative*

### 3.1 ASPECT MODEL "SingleLevelBoMAsSpecified"

The SingleLevelBoMAsSpecified defines the view of the OEM or producer of the whole product, e.g. the OEM of a vehicle. It is free of any supplier-related information and specifies the promised and guaranteed content of the whole product to the end customer. This “top-down” view contrasts with the “bottom-up” view of the SingleLevelBoMAsPlanned, though several sub-aspects are shared. The SingleLevelBoMAsSpecified is merely one aspect, which is attached to the twin of the whole product and itself does neither introduce further twins nor reference them. Instead, it merely comprises all functional information required by dismantlers, workshops, or requestors for used parts to search for and to make a match on the marketplace.

The semantic model has the unique identifier:

```text
  urn:samm:io.catenax.single_level_bom_as_specified:2.0.0#
```
