# CX-0080 BPDM Fraud Prevention Service v1.1.0

## ABSTRACT

Digital fraud risks are constantly increasing, e.g., in the form of fake invoices sent in the name of real suppliers, but with third-party (fraudster) account data.
The Fraud Prevention Service provides information on most recent fraud cases which have been shared within the Catena-X (CX) network by contributing companies.
It therefore benefits from the overall idea of data sharing within the Catena-X community as such information is nowhere available in any data source accessible along the automotive supply chain.

There is a strong need to create such a reliable data source by anonymously sharing fraud details within the CX member network.

This data shall be made accessible and consumable via dashboard & reporting functionalities.

By using this information, the CX community has the chance to prevent fraud cases in their own companies as they can use shared data about e.g., fraudulent bank accounts to stop payments and so avoid financial losses and reputation damage.

The purpose of this standard is to describe guidelines and requirements specific for the challenges of fraud risks in order to minimize such threats and implications for the own company.  It focuses on fraudulent bank data as the most common fraud type although other relevant fraud types are also considered.

## FOR WHOM IS THE STANDARD DESIGNED

This standard is designed for Business Application Provider.

|1.1.0       | 2024-03-13          | Updated to template v2.0.0. Added chapter 2.6 Data Types and 2.8 Data Attributes, Added chapter 2.7 for data sovereignty as additional requirement.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 AUDIENCE & SCOPE

> *This section is non-normative*

This standard is relevant for the following audience:

- Catena-X certified Operational Companies acting as:
  - Business Application Provider
  - Data Provider and Consumer

This document focuses on the requirements regarding provision of fraud data and getting access to such data via reporting- / dashboard functionalities.

It is relevant for business application providers who want to provide services for collecting, aggregating and reporting fraud data by empowering the CX companies to provide such data in an easy but formalized, secure and anonymous way.

It is also relevant for data providers and consumers as it is initially the CX community who acts as data provider and consumer itself and can be extended with other communities or data providers.

> Data Sovereignty: The FPS API allows to download DQD quality results of business partner data in a data sovereign way, because each Catena-X member has its own area of business partner data in BPDM, where private data (like customer / supplier relationships) is only visible to the Catena-X member.

### 1.2 CONTEXT AND ARCHITECTURE FIT

> *This section is non-normative*

Fraud prevention service (FPS) is a value-added service (VAS) in the area of Business Partner Data Management which addresses the challenges for a company in terms of legal, compliance- and finance-related requirements.

FPS has to visualize the outcome of the fraud prevention screening results via a dashboard.

FPS uses the Gate API CX-0074_v3.0.0 and the Pool API CX-0012_v4.0.0 based on the CX-0018 Data Space Connectivity 3.0.0
for pulling BP data records. FPS is a client/ server cloud application which contains a Web Client and a Cloud Server Application.

### 1.3 CONFORMANCE AND PROOF OF CONFORMITY

> *This section is non-normative*

All sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**, **RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD** and **SHOULD NOT** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All participants and their solutions will need to prove, that they are conform with the Catena-X standards. To validate that the standards are applied correctly, Catena-X employs Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).

To prove conformity with this standard providing a self-audited, stated and signed document that the syntax of the number is established is needed.

POST MAY also be used for read requests, if input is not given by parameters but rather by an HTTP body to bypass maximum URL length. PUT MAY also be used for upsert requests (create or update) if this is required. A state (active / inactive) at each entity MUST be used for a soft delete, so that the request method DELETE SHALL NOT be used. Other HTTP request methods SHALL NOT be used, including PATCH.

Uploading and downloading data to/from the FPD API MUST follow a staging concept with two stages, so that consumers of the FPD API can compare what they have uploaded  into the input stage against what kind of BDV rule results and status code was provided for each bank data in the output stage. The following controllers MUST distinguish between an input and an output stage.

The resources MUST use the HTTP request methods for READ operations:

- GET MUST be used for read requests

### 2.8 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

#### 2.8.1 CONVENTIONS FOR USE CASE POLICY IN CONTEXT OF DATA EXCHANGE
  
In alignment with our commitment to data sovereignty, a specific framework governing the utilization of data within the Catena-X use cases has been outlined. A set of specific policies on data offering and data usage level detail the conditions under which data may be accessed, shared, and used, ensuring compliance with legal standards.
  
For a comprehensive understanding of the rights, restrictions, and obligations associated with data usage in the Catena-X ecosystem, we refer users to

- the detailed [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile). This document provides in-depth explanations of the terms and conditions applied to data access and utilization, ensuring that all engagement with our data is conducted responsibly and in accordance with established guidelines.
- the ODRL schema template. This defines how policies used for data sharing/usage should get defined. Those schemas **MUST** be followed when providing services or apps for data sharing/consuming.

#### 2.8.2 ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING ACCESS POLICIES

A Data Provider may tie certain access authorizations ("Access Policies") to its data offers for members of Catena-X and one or several Data Consumers. By limiting access to certain Participants, Data Provider maintains control over its anti-trust obligations when sharing certain data. In particular, Data Provider may apply Access Policies to restrict access to a particular data offer for only one Participant identified by a specific business partner number:

- Membership
- BPNL

#### 2.8.3 ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING USAGE POLICIES

In the context of data usage policies (“Usage Policies”), Participants and related services **MUST** use the following policy rules:

- Use Case Framework (“FrameworkAgreement”)
- at least one use case purpose (“UsagePurpose”) from the above mentioned [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

Additionally, respective usage policies **MAY** include the following policy rule:

- Reference Contract (“ContractReference”).

Details on  namespaces and ODRL policy rule values to be used for the above-mentioned types are provided via the [ODRL policy repository](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

### 2.9 ERROR HANDLING

The following http response codes MUST be defined for all resources:

- 200 – OK  
- 400 – Bad Request
- 401 – Unauthorized
- 403 – Forbidden
- 404 – Not Found  
- 500 – Internal Server Error
