title: Catena-X - From Idea to Standard
---

Each standard is owned by a designated association body, such as a [Committee](../organizational-structure/catena-x/committee.md) or [Expert Group](../organizational-structure/catena-x/expert-group.md), which holds the sole authority to approve any modifications contentwise. Any request to modify a standard must first be approved by the standard's owner. All requests lacking the approval are going to be declined in the request process.

The standard owner can decide if they want to do the changes themself or if they grant the requester the permission to change the standard and only review the changes contentwise.

:::warning[NOTE]
This page contains a summary of the standardization process. The normative description of the process can be found [here](https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/user_upload/Vereinsdokumente/Catena-X_IP_Regelwerk_IP_Regulations.pdf).

## Phase 1: Preparation

During the preparation phase demands for new Standards or for the change of an existing one must be identified. Both might cause of adaptations in Semantic Models, Logic/Schema, API Specification, Protocols. All intended work on standards should be announced in the Association.

### Preparation ToDo's

- [Create roadmap item](../release-management/planning/cx-roadmap-item-creation.md)

### Preparation Milestones

- [Release Roadmap Review](../release-management/planning/cx-release-roadmap-review.md)

## Phase 2: Planning

A detailed description of the change request or new standard request is needed and should be refined during the planning phase. The detailed description needs to be discussed during the planning days with the audience (all Association members) and especially with the TC4S (Technical Committee 4 Standardization). All [dependencies](https://jschuetz88.github.io/cx-dependencies) must be identified, discussed and aligned.

### Planning ToDo's

- [Standard Request Creation](../release-management/planning/std-standard-request-creation.md)

### Planning Milestones

- [Release planning days](../release-management/planning/std-standard-planning.md)
- [Quality Gate 1](../release-management/development-and-release/quality-gate-1.md)

## Phase 3: Development

New standards and changes of existing standards must be created in the standardization repository. Each standard request is implemented in an own branch.

If multiple individuals seek to implement a standard request and need alignment, they must organize this collaboration themselves. The private workspace of the respective Expert Group should be utilized for this purpose.

### Development timeline

- [Main creation phase](../release-management/development-and-release/main-creation-phase.md)
- [Quality Gate 2](../release-management/development-and-release/quality-gate-2.md)
- [Opt-Out period](../release-management/development-and-release/opt-out-period.md)
