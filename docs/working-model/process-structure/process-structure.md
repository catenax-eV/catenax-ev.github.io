This chapter contextualizes the various phases of a Catena-X release within the framework of the necessary processes.

During a Catena-X release cycle, numerous roadmap items must be addressed. These items can be categorized into three primary groups:

- [**Tractus-X**](tractus-x-from-idea-to-production.md): This category includes items such as Kits, Reference Implementations, API Specifications, Protocols, Sample Data, Architecture, Documentation, Deployment Scripts, and Tutorials.
- [**Catena-X**](catena-x-from-idea-to-standard.md): This category encompasses Standards (due to adaptations in Semantic Models, Logic/Schema, API Specifications, Protocols) and Whitepapers (which may result in Kits adaptations).
- **Organizational**: This category involves tasks such as setting up Expert Groups and promoting Use Cases.

All three categories share the same phases for a release:

- **Planning**: Define the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the release.
- **Refinement**: Refine and finalize the requirements and design, Prepare detailed plans for implementation and ensure readiness for the implementation phase.
- **Implementation**: Implement the roadmap items, ensure the release meets quality standards and prepare for post-release activities

Each category has specific processes that must be adhered to in order to contribute to a Catena-X release. Detailed requirements for each process are described on the respective process pages.
