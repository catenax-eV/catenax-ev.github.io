title: Overview of Release phases a processes
---

A Catena-X release is built upon roadmap items, which serve as the overarching framework for all association efforts to advance the data space in a specific area. These roadmap items are further refined by narrowing their scope, aiming to create actionable tasks. They may be broken down into the following categories:

- [**Normative documents**](./process-normative-documents.md): This category encompasses mostly Standards (due to adaptations in Semantic Models, Logic/Schema, API Specifications, Protocols) but also other normative documents (e.g. the operating modell). Normative documents can only be released after a final approval of the Management Board.

- [**Tractus-X**](./process-tractus-x.md): This category includes items such as KITs, Reference Implementations, API Specifications, Protocols, Sample Data, Architecture, Documentation, Deployment Scripts, and Tutorials.

- [**Non-normative documents**](./process-non-normative-documents.md): Non-normative documents, such as whitepapers, are not subject to a formal release process governed by the Association. However, to ensure high quality and consistency, they must be reviewed by the responsible Committee.

- [**Organizational**](./process-organizational.md): Organizational: This category includes tasks like establishing Expert Groups and promoting Use Cases. The Committee is responsible for defining the process, while the association may offer best practices and support.

Regardless of the specific tasks involved, every release is structured into three phases:

- **Planning**: Establish the scope, objectives, and deliverables by defining roadmap items.
- **Refinement**: Finalize requirements and design, develop detailed implementation plans, and break down roadmap items to ensure readiness.
- **Implementation**: Execute actionable items, maintain quality standards, and prepare for post-release activities.
