In addition to standards and Tractus-X artifacts, the association publishes non-normative documents (e.g., white papers), following a simplified release process with fewer stages than standards. The stages are:

1. [Planing](#planing)
2. [Creation](#creation)
3. [Release](#release)

## Release Stages For Non-Normatice Documents

### Planing

The creation of these documents must be planned in the GitHub repository of the Expert Group by creating an issue.

### Creation

During this phase, the document is drafted collaboratively within the Expert Group. Authors develop the content, ensuring alignment with the associationâ€™s goals and quality expectations. Feedback and contributions from group members are incorporated through iterative reviews. The draft is maintained in the GitHub repository, where updates and revisions are tracked transparently.

After the creation phase, the document MUST undergo a review by the committee, serving as a quality gate before progressing further in the release process.

### Release

Once approved, the document must be officially published by the Expert Group. At a minimum, this involves adding it to their KIT, ensuring accessibility and visibility within the association. Additional publication channels may be used as needed.
