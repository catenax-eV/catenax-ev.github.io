The work in this cluster follows no strict requirements regarding how it should be planned and executed. The only minimal requirement is that all work items must be planned and maintained in the GitHub repository of the responsible association body.

Work items may include tasks such as:

- preparing a one-pager for an Expert Group tender,
- organizing events,
- creating communication materials,
- conducting internal workshops, or
- coordinating collaboration with external stakeholders.

Ensuring the quality of a work item is the responsibility of the respective group, which may define its own processes and quality measures as needed.
