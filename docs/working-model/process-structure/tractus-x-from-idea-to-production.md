![Overview Tractus-X Release phases](assets/release-planing-next-steps-horizontal-tractus-x.drawio.svg)

## Phase 1: Planning

The Planning Phase is the foundational phase that sets the direction and scope for the entire release. It ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the release's content.

All planned work on Kits, Reference Implementation, API Specification, Protocols, Sample Data, Architecture, Documentation, Deployment Scripts or Tutorials should be announced during this phase.

### Planning milestones

## Phase 2: Refinement

The Refinement Phase is a critical stage in the project or release lifecycle where initial plans and requirements are detailed, validated, and prepared for implementation. The goal of this phase is to ensure that all aspects of the project are clearly understood, accurately defined, and ready to be built, reducing the risk of issues during the implementation phase.

This phase involves breaking down high-level requirements into detailed specifications, addressing any ambiguities, and preparing comprehensive plans that guide the subsequent development and implementation activities.

The Refinement Phase is crucial because it bridges the gap between initial planning and actual development. By thoroughly detailing and validating all aspects of the project, it reduces the risk of misunderstandings, scope creep, and technical issues during the implementation phase. This phase ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and agreed-upon understanding of what will be built and how, thereby facilitating a smoother and more predictable implementation process.

### Refinement milestones

- [Refinement day](../release-management/planning/refinement-day.md)
- [Draft feature freeze](../release-management/planning/draft-feature-freeze.md)
- Open Planning Cut-off Features must have mandatory content from the DoE and approval before the open planning meeting. This is a critical deadline.
- Release planning days

To enter the Open Planning a feature proposal must meet the DoE X days before the Open Planning (Cut-Off)! Feature proposal that meet the DoE after the Cut-Off won't be considered in the Open Planning. This means it will likely be deferred to a future release.

## Phase 3: Implementation

The development and release phase includes the development of the software and standards. The individual units are developed and tested in up to six increments. This is followed by final integration and end-to-end test for the software.

### Implementation milestones

- [Development (Increment 1 - 6)](../release-management/development-and-release/increment-1-6.md)
- [Feature Freeze](../release-management/development-and-release/feature-freeze.md)
- [E2E Test](../release-management/development-and-release/e2e-test.md)
