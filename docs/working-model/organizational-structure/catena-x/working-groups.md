# Working Groups

Working Groups are dynamic, focused, and temporary teams established to explore and evaluate specific topics that fall outside the current scope of the association. They operate as agile "fast boats," swiftly exploring new topics to assess the relevance and potential impact of emerging issues, opportunities, or challenges for the association.

## Exploratory Mission

 Working Groups are tasked with delving into specific topics or issues that have yet to be covered by existing committees. Their primary goal is to explore these areas in-depth, gathering information, analyzing trends, and assessing their significance for the association. Acting like a testing facility, these groups provide a quick, efficient, and flexible mechanism for the association to respond to new developments. They can be mobilized rapidly to investigate and report back on their findings, ensuring that the association remains proactive and forward-thinking.

 Working groups are typically setup by the [management board](./management-board.md) and are composed of members with relevant expertise or interest in the topic at hand. This ensures a focused and knowledgeable approach to the issue being investigated.

## Direct Reporting

Unlike Expert Groups, Working Groups are not linked to a particular committee. Instead, they report directly to a managing director. This direct line of communication ensures that their findings are quickly integrated into the association's strategic considerations.
