# Management board

## Association Strategy

The Management Board is responsible to develop, maintain and communicate the Association strategy. The strategy focuses on the overall mission, vision, and long-term objectives of the Association. It defines the broad purpose of the Association and its key goals.

Decisions include determining the areas of focus for the Association, establishing partnerships, and setting the overall direction. This level may also involve decisions about expanding the Association's reach or services.

The primary goal is to enhance the value provided to members and other stakeholders, ensuring the Associationâ€™s sustainability and growth. This might involve increasing membership, enhancing influence, or expanding the range of services offered.

## Management board - Committees

The Management Board holds significant responsibility in determining and overseeing the relevant business domains for the association. Once these domains are identified, the Board ensures they are adequately covered through the establishment and management of committees. Here are the specific responsibilities of the Management Board in this context:

- **Initiating new Committees**: The management can form new Committees and hands them over the responsibility for a specific domain.

- **Closing Expert Groups**: If a Committee is no longer needed, the management board has the authority to disband them.

- **Oversight and Governance**: Committees operate under the guidance and oversight of two sponsors, who must be member of the management board

- **Escalation Point**: The Management Board acts as the last point of escalation for any significant issues or challenges that arise within the association. This function is executed through the [mediation board member](#mediation-board-member).

## Management board roles

### Board sponsor

Board sponsors ensure that the committees strategy and initiatives align with the organization's overall strategic goals and objectives. They act as the liaison between the committee and the board, facilitating clear and effective communication and ensures that the committee has the support needed from other parts of the organization.

### Mediation board member

The mediation board member is elected by from and by the management board. The mediation board member serves as the ultimate decision-maker when conflicts or disputes cannot be resolved at lower levels within the association. They provide a final, binding resolution to escalated issues, ensuring that decisions are fair and just.
