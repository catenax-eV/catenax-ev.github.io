# Catena-X Organizational Structure

Each group or role is vital to the project's ecosystem and contributes uniquely to its growth and direction. **As we delve into the specifics of each role, we invite you to consider where your skills and interests may best align with the needs of the project.** Whether you are just starting out or looking to increase your involvement, there is a place for everyone to contribute and make an impact in our open source community.

## Eclipse Tractus-X Project

- Tractus-X is structured along products (repos) or use cases
- Committers / Contributors are mapped to products or use cases
- Each contributor can propose features in sig-release
- Committers make the decision which features will be committed in the next release
- Outcome:
  - Planning: Committed, prioritized backlog for a release
  - Release: Release Train

1. [**Contributor**](tractus-x/contributor.md): Contributors are the backbone of any open source project. They are individuals who offer their skills and time to contribute to the project in various forms, such as code, documentation, design, or community support.

2. [**Committer**](tractus-x/committer.md): Committers are contributors who have been granted the ability to directly access the project's code repository to make changes. They have a deeper level of commitment to the project and are responsible for reviewing and accepting contributions from others.

## Collaboration between Catena-X and Eclipse Tractus-X

![Collaboration](./assets/expert-group-experts-committers.drawio.svg)

Even if it appears to be an organisational separation, it is important to understand that Catena-X and Tractus-X must work closely together. The Expert Groups and Committees are the ones who define the features and the roadmap. The committers are the ones who implement the features and the roadmap. The experts are the ones who provide the knowledge and the expertise to the committers.

The committers are responsible for the prioritization of the features within the open-source boards. committers are also responsible for overarching topics like quality, security, and functionality. Committers are representatives of their own company and should also work/support within the Expert Groups.

## Other Initiatives

Other initiatives (such as Manufacturing-X) can use this process to propose:

- Feature proposals
- Standardization candidates (?)

"Use this process" means they are either Tractus-X Contributor and/or member of an Expert Group.
