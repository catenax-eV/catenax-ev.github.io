## Business domain ownership

Committees serve as the sole strategic owners of a business domain, meaning they are responsible for defining the vision, setting long-term goals, and making key decisions that shape the direction of that domain. They oversee the development and execution of strategies, ensuring alignment with the associationâ€™s overall objectives. The committees tasks are:

- **Business domain strategy**: The Committee is responsible for developing a clear and forward-looking strategy for the business domainby breaking down the [vision](https://catena-x.net/en/vision) and [mission](https://catena-x.net/en/benefits) of the Catena-X association for the respective domain. The strategy should serve as a beacon for all strategic decisions (strategic horizon 3 month, 12 month, 3 years).

- **Standards management**: Committees own dedicated [standards](https://bcgcatenax.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/MitgliederbereichMemberArea_Catena-XAutomotiveNetworke.V/_layouts/15/Doc2.aspx?action=edit&sourcedoc=%7B9f834319-f51e-468c-8e69-1da76f8b50c6%7D&wdOrigin=TEAMS-MAGLEV.teamsSdk_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1720772259595&web=1).

Committees must check during the [planning process](../process-structure/process-tractus-x.md#phase-2-planning) that all features a strategically aligned to the Associations goals.

## Committee and the Association

Committees act as representatives of all members within an association, ensuring that the interests and needs of the broader membership are reflected in their decisions. As such, committees must be transparent about their work and incorporate feedback into their decissions. The measures to do so are:

- **Regualar sounding**: Committees must organize a regular [sounding](../process-structure/association-general.md#sounding) event at least every 6 month.

- **Feedback channel**: In order to receive feedback and input from other association member a feedback channel must be kept and communicated.

- **Collaboration across domains**: Committees should proactively [connect with one another](../process-structure/association-general.md) to drive the Association forward, ensuring alignment across various domains and initiatives.

## Committee and Expert Groups

Committees have the mandate to achieve their goals through the establishment and management of Expert Groups. The functions in reagards to Expert Groups include:

- **Initiating new Expert Groups**: Committees can form new Expert Groups within their domain to address specific topics or issues.

- **Providing Mentoring to Expert Groups**: Committees offer guidance and support to Expert Groups to help them achieve their objectives effectively. To facilitate this, the Committee can create the role of a [mentor](#mentor-for-expert-groups), assigning a dedicated person to provide expertise, advice, and ongoing support.

- **Closing Expert Groups**: When an Expert Group has fulfilled its purpose or is no longer needed, committees have the authority to disband them.
