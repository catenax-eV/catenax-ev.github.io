title: Overview
---

This working model is meticulously designed for members of our association and those involved in the various association bodies. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the organizational structure, the specific roles within the association, and the interrelation between Catena-X and Tractus-X. It includes detailed information on planning and building (Plan and Build), contrasting with the [Operating model](/docs/next/operating-model/why-introduction) that describes the model for the production/live environment (Run).

## Audience and Purpose

- **Association body members**: To delineate their specific roles and responsibilities within the association body ([Committees](./organizational-structure/catena-x/committee.md) and [Expert Groups](./organizational-structure/catena-x/expert-group.md)).
- **New members**: To facilitate a smooth onboarding process by explaining the association's framework.
- **Stakeholders and Contributors**: To guide those who wish to participate in the [creation or modification of standards](./process-structure/catena-x-from-idea-to-standard.md) or [contribute to the open-source initiatives](./process-structure/tractus-x-from-idea-to-production.md) including other initiatives similar to Catena-X.
