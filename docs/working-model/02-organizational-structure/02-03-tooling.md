This is just a short description about the different tools. The usage of these tools is described in the corresponding [sections](../03-process-from-idea-to-production/03-01-process-from-idea-to-production.md).

## Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a good starting point for Expert Groups and Committees. After they are built up, they can decide to use GitHub in a private repository, or MS Team in a private channel.

:::warning
All open-source content has to be in Tractus-X. The private teams and repository are more for the day to day work, files and task planner/ issue tracker
:::

### Main topic

- Communication system
- Taskplanning
- Filestorage
- "Knowledgestore"

## GitHub

GitHub is the main tool for development, when we talk about the Eclipse Tractus-X Project, the open-source part. GitHub is also getting more and more relevant for the Committee and Expert Group work.

There are two main organizations in GitHub:

- [catenax-eV (Catena-X Automotive Network e.V.)](https://github.com/catenax-eV/) -> standards, Committee and Expert Group work
- [eclipse-tractusx -> Eclipse Tractus-X Project](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx) -> open-source

:::note

- for the open-source part (reference implementations and Kits) GitHub is mandatory. Its used for planning, issue tracking, discussions, development, reviews and release etc.
- for the standardization part, GitHub is also set as mandatory
- for Committee work and Expert Groups the Association provides private repositories within the *catenax-eV* GitHub organization

## Eclipse Tooling

In Eclipse Tractus-X we mainly use open-source tooling provided by the Eclipse Foundation [https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/intro](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/intro)

The Eclipse Foundation provides a `Matrix Chat` for open communication. It can be used via Eclipse account. There are several rooms available for different topics. The main room for Tractus-X is [#tractusx:matrix.eclipse.org](https://matrix.to/#/#tractusx:matrix.eclipse.org).

There is also a [tractusx-dev mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev) available to reach out to all subscribed Tractus-X contributor. Within this list the important open meetings are shared as also committer elections and other important information related to Tractus-X.
