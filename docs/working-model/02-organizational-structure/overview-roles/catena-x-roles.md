## General

The **Catena-X Automotive Network e.V.** is often referred to as 'the association'. It is important to understand that the association consists of four bodies with different tasks and responsibilities. The association bodies are:

- The Management board
- Committees
- Expert Groups
- Catena-X office

![The association](../assets/cx-association-overview.drawio.svg)

As the association, all four bodies aim to advance Catena-X as the leading global data ecosystem for the automotive value chain. In order to do so they follow the SOAR model.

- **S** = Standardizes to lay the foundation/basis for the ecosystem
- **O** = Orchestrates to structure and organize the ecosystem
- **A** = Activates by making standards applicable and relevant
- **R** = Represent as the only ones speaking for Catena-X

Please note that while this page captures the essence of the Committee and the Expert Group roles, it is not exhaustive. The dynamic nature of the association means that roles can evolve, and members of the Committee and Expert Groups may engage in additional activities beyond what is described here. The descriptions below are intended to serve as a guide, providing a clear indication of the expected contributions of the Committee and the Expert Groups, yet it allows for flexibility and adaptation as the project and its needs grow and change.

The RASIC should provide an overview of the tasks the Association bodies are engaging in. Each individual in the Mgmt. board, a Committee or an Expert Group is at least a "member". If one takes over additional roles, e.g. as "Lead", the responsibilities of that role are added to those as member. In detail, the responsibilities for specific individual aspects may differ slightly (but always in alignment with this overarching RASIC.

## Expert Group

The aim of the Expert Groups within the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. is to develop results together with the members in line with the association's strategic direction. The Expert Groups are initiated and managed by the related Committee. Expert Groups don't exist forever. They work on dedicated topics, present the results to the Committee and are then [retired](#closing-of-expert-groups). If a follow up is required, a new Expert Group has to be initiated.

![Expert Group Lifeline](../assets/expert-group-life-line-v2.drawio.svg)

The life of an Expert Group is devided into three phases:

1. Initiaion
2. Working Phase
3. Closing

The overview of the existing Expert Groups can be found in the [organizational chart](https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/user_upload/06_Ueber_uns/Ueber_uns_der_Verein/OrgaChart_Website.pdf) on the Catena-X homepage.

### Functional level strategy

The functional level strategy involves the specific operational activities within a Expert Groups. It deals with the day-to-day tasks and processes that need to be executed to support the business domain strategy.

The focus lies on implementation, realisation and the delivery of tangible results.

### Tasks and responsibilities for Expert Groups

In addition to the results to be elaborated in terms of content, the working groups have to fulfil the following, overarching tasks:

- Elaboration of the strategic orientation
- Advancing standardisation
- Realisation of the strategic roadmap of the association
- Harmonisation of interests  
- Achieving majority feedback on the orientation of the association
- Identifying areas for action
- Focus on tangible results

### Expert Group Initiation

1. **Request Submission**: Interested individuals or organizations seeking to form an Expert Group may submit their requests to the Catena-X Association. These requests will be assigned to a committee for consideration. The committee will add the request to its agenda for validation.
2. **Validation and approval**: The committee will conduct an initial validation of the request. If deemed valid, the requester will be required to submit a one-page document outlining the challenge the Expert Group aims to address, the current status, and the objectives the group should achieve. This document ensures a clear understanding of the group's goals and scope.
3. **Application Phase**: The one-page document serves as the foundation for the Application Phase. Employees of association members are invited to apply for a seat in the Expert Group. Members of the group will be selected based on predefined criteria.
4. **Notification and Kick-Off**: All applicants will be informed of the outcome of their application (core team, review team, or rejected). Core team members will be invited to a kick-off meeting for the group's inaugural session, typically scheduled two weeks after the conclusion of the application phase.

### Working phase

During their working phase, Expert Groups are expected to continuously develop and advance their assigned topics. This involves regular meetings, collaborative research, and consistent communication among members to ensure progress. Additionally, planned work and results should be regularly shared within the association to promote transparency and collective insight. The groups should also provide periodic updates to the committee, highlighting key milestones, challenges encountered, and any adjustments to their objectives. Active engagement and a commitment to innovation and improvement are essential to the success of the Expert Groups in achieving their goals.

The composition of the Expert Groups is not static and is expected to change over the life time. In any case people that want to join an existing Expert Group need to be approved the same way, as applicants for new Expert Groups. If a Expert Group member is stepping down from its position, it can not be handed over to another employee of the same company.

### Closing of Expert Groups

Once a Expert Group delivered its dedicated topic, a regulated closing takes place. The Committee validates the results of the Expert Group as after the closure of the Expert Group, the responsibility for the topic transitions to the Committee. When the results are validated. The Expert Group is then officially discharged and closed by Committee.

A final documentation of the work results on the digital collaboration platform is mandatory, and every Expert Group member is required to contribute to this. The documentation is to be made accessible to every member in coordination with the office.

## Escalation path

If an issue cannot be resolved by the designated association body, it must be escalated to the appropriate higher authority. The escalation pathway is as follows:

1. **Expert Groups**: Issues should initially be addressed within the Expert Groups. If the Expert Group Members are unable to find a solution, a vote may be conducted to reach a decision. Should the vote fail to achieve a majority or if an Expert Group member raises substantial concerns regarding the outcome, the issue may be escalated.
2. **Responsible Committee**: If the Expert Groups are unable to resolve the issue, it is escalated to the responsible committee. This committee is tasked with oversight and decision-making based on broader organizational perspectives.
3. **Board Sponsors**: Should the committee find the issue beyond its scope of resolution, the matter is escalated to the Board Sponsors. These senior members of the board provide strategic guidance and authoritative decisions on escalated matters.
4. **Mediation Board Member**: As the final level of escalation, unresolved issues are directed to a Mediation Board Member. This individual is empowered to mediate and resolve high-level disputes or complex issues that could not be settled at prior levels.
