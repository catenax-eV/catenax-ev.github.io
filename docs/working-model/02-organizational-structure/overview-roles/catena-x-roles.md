## General

The **Catena-X Automotive Network e.V.** is often referred to as 'the association'. It is important to understand that the association consists of four bodies with different tasks and responsibilities. The association bodies are:

- The Management board
- Committees
- Expert Groups
- Catena-X office

![The association](../assets/cx-association-overview.drawio.svg)

As the association, all four bodies aim to advance Catena-X as the leading global data ecosystem for the automotive value chain. In order to do so they follow the SOAR model.

- **S** = Standardizes to lay the foundation/basis for the ecosystem
- **O** = Orchestrates to structure and organize the ecosystem
- **A** = Activates by making standards applicable and relevant
- **R** = Represent as the only ones speaking for Catena-X

Please note that while this page captures the essence of the Committee and the Expert Group roles, it is not exhaustive. The dynamic nature of the association means that roles can evolve, and members of the Committee and Expert Groups may engage in additional activities beyond what is described here. The descriptions below are intended to serve as a guide, providing a clear indication of the expected contributions of the Committee and the Expert Groups, yet it allows for flexibility and adaptation as the project and its needs grow and change.

The RASIC should provide an overview of the tasks the Association bodies are engaging in. Each individual in the Mgmt. board, a Committee or an Expert Group is at least a "member". If one takes over additional roles, e.g. as "Lead", the responsibilities of that role are added to those as member. In detail, the responsibilities for specific individual aspects may differ slightly (but always in alignment with this overarching RASIC.

## Expert Group

The aim of the Expert Groups within the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. is to develop results together with the members in line with the association's strategic direction. The Expert Groups are [initiated](#expert-group-initiation) and managed by the related Committee. Expert Groups don't exist forever. They work on dedicated topics, present the results to the Committee and are then [retired](#closing-of-expert-groups). If a follow up is required, a new Expert Group has to be initiated.

- ...
- ...
- ...

### Expert Group Initiation

Association members can join any Expert Groups by applying for open seats. The recommended size for Expert Groups is 5 to 15 core team members. Less core team members might indicated that the topic is not relevant enough to the assosciation and cause the Expert Group not being established. More core team members would make the Expert Group to inflexible and a split of the Expert Group might be considered.

The composition of the core team is considering a balance between OEM, tier-1, tier-2, tier-n and small, medium and large sized companies with up to one participant per company with one voting right per company.

The members of the core team are selected according to the following criteria:

- Proper expertise in the relevant field of the Expert Group
- Minimum availability of 20 hours per month, more is a plus
- Commitment to regular, active participation and active contribution

Based on their availability, applicants are assigned either to the core or the review team:

- The **core team** is responsible for creating and working on dedicated features. The group acts here as a requester for the features and drives the development.
- The **review team** acts as a sparring partner to the core team and provides feedback on a regular basis. The review team has no recommended team size.

#### Request Submission

Individuals or organizations interested in forming an Expert Group can reach out to the Catena-X Association. The request is then going to be assigned to an committe. The request is then added to the Committee's agenda for validation.

#### Initial validation

The Committee is going to do a initial validation of the request. If the request is deemed valid, one of the Committee members is going to be assigned to the request to serve as the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for requestors and guides them through the initiation process. The mentor explains the process and provides necessary documents to the requestors.

#### Onepager creation

Once the request is validated, the requester has to write a onepager describing the challenge the Expert Group should tackle, what the status quo is and state the objectives the Expert Group should achieve. The requester is going to be supported by the mentor. The onepager ensures a comprehensive understanding of the group's objectives and scope.

#### Final validation

The onepager then has to be presented to the Committee. The committe then approves or disapproves the request.

#### Application Phase

Validated request are then taken over by the association which is then starting the application phase for the Expert Group. The application phase typically lasts around two to four weeks.

#### Expert Group composition

All applicants are going to be reviewed by the mentor. Based on predefined criteria the members for the Expert Group are going to be selected. If there are sufficient applicants, an optional review group may be created (see [Expert Group election](#expert-group-initiation)).

#### Expert Group approval

Once the application phase is complete, the mentor seeks final approval from managing director value and technology creation, Catena-X e.V., for the formation of the Expert Group.

#### Notification and Kick-off

Upon approval, the mentor informs all applicatns the outcome of their application (core team, review team or rejected). Core team members are invited to a kick-off for the group's inaugural meeting (usually two weeks after the application phase ended).

#### Review Group Formation

If applicable, the mentor informs all review group members about the process and schedules the first review session.

#### Kickoff

During the kickoff the mentor presents the overall process, including reporting to the Committee and the next review session with the review group. Additionally, the mentor supports with lead selection and then hands over the leadership responsibilities to the appointed leads.

### Expert Group maintenance over the life time

The composition of the Expert Groups is not static and is expected to change over the life time of the Expert Group. In any case people that want to join an existing Expert Group need to be approved the same way, as applicants for new Expert Groups. This means they need to be approved by the mentor of the Expert Group and the managing director value and technology creation.

#### Replacement of Expert Group members

If a Expert Group member is stepping down from its position, it can not be handed over to another employee of the same company. The replacement needs to be approved.

#### Adding additional members

The recommended maximal number of Expert Group members is 15. If the Expert Group has less members, new members might be added. If the number of members is greater than 15, new members might be added after consideration by the Committee.

### Closing of Expert Groups

Once a Expert Group delivered its dedicated topic, a regulated closing takes place. The Committee validates the results of the Expert Group as after the closure of the Expert Group, the responsibility for the topic transitions to the Committee. When the results are validated. The Expert Group is then officially discharged and closed by Committee.

A final documentation of the work results on the digital collaboration platform is mandatory, and every Expert Group member is required to contribute to this. The documentation is to be made accessible to every member in coordination with the office.

The closure of the Expert Committee is communicated to all members, and the results are accessible to them.

### Expert Group Decision Making & Communication

![Expert Group meeting intervals](../assets/expert-group-meeting-interval.drawio.svg)

Expert Groups are required to be transparent about their work and communicate regualarely with other association members to gather their feedback.

- The Expert Group should meet on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule to align internally
- If the Expert Group has a review group a monthly exchange should be scheduled to present the work of the Expert Group and get feedback
- A quarterly sounding event should be organised to inform all associations members about the work of the Expert Group and forthcoming initiatives. This event should be aligned with next release planning, to allow ample time for the integration of any valuable feedback that may arise.
