Work in progress
:::

- Catena-X is structured along Committees and Expert Groups

  - Role of Catena-X Association
  - Rolle der Mitarbeiter innerhalb im Verein (z.B. Expert Groups, Committees)
  - The Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. promotes, sponsors, and coordinates the overlying requirements of the Eclipse Tractus-X Project.

Committees and Expert Groups are advertised, selected, and established on the basis of a “requirement”. The application phases are similar and the distributors are always the Catena-X members. More information can be found [here](./overview-roles/overview-roles.md).

To get a better overview of the given Committees and Expert Groups, there will be a SharePoint page within the member area. Information about:

- The groups
- Purpose

- Milestones

Can be found there.
