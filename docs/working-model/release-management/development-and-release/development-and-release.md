# Development & Release (week 15 â€“ 30)

The development and release phase includes the development of the software and standards. The individual units are developed and tested in up to six increments. This is followed by final integration and end-to-end test for the software. In addition there is an opt-out phase for commenting on the developed standards (45 days). If successful the individual units will be released and published.
