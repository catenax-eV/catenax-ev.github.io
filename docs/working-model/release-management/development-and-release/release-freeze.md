# Release Freeze (End of Increment 6)

## Milestone

No further functional code changes for the current CX Release.

## Code Version

- The tested code-version for the current CX Release is final.
  - FOSS released in Tractus-X, including Release Notes (changelog.md) and documentation.
  - Any verifications (for example final SEC scans) will refer and be based on this version.

## E2E Tests

- E2E tests completed.
  - Either completely successful.
  - Or all relevant bugs have been fixed and successfully tested afterward.
    - Loops and bugfixes and accepted in E2E test phase - between E2E test start and release freeze milestone - orchestrated by central Test Management.
  - Results documented.

## Timeslot between Release Freeze milestone and E2E Test end

- Finalization of E2E tests is ok (including repeated or regression-tests).
- There is no more bugfixing for the current Release (code is final).
- Positive test results will be documented in the final overall test report.
- Negative or incomplete results have to be documented as "known knowns" for the current Release in the Release Notes (decide on a case-by-case basis if documentation on product level or within Overarching Release Note is appropriate).
