# Quality Gate 1 (QG1)

A first quality gate (“quality gate I”) ensures that standard candidates moving forward are limited to those that adhere to the values and goals of the Catena-X data ecosystem. Each standard candidate is checked for relevance, redundancy, and conformance. Provided a green light has been given, the standard candidate is officially transferred into the release schedule.

All standard requests in CX Houston MUST be submitted prior to the start of QG1. A later submission of a standard request will be rejected by default!
