# Increment 1 - 6

## Task

To Dos:

- Multiple increments / codes may be created within a Sprint (time-boxed iteration).
- The sum of the increments is presented at the Sprint Review.

## Outcome

- Several increments as the latest stable version of the product.
  - Latest: The product is developed incrementally, with each new increment aiming to be more valuable than the previous one.
  - Stable: Every increment meets the Definition of Done and is usable by users.
- Each increment is additive to all prior increments, meaning that every new increment builds upon the previous ones.
- Increments are thoroughly verified, ensuring that they work together seamlessly.

## Timeline

- 2 weeks per increment
