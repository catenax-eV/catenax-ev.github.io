# Release Management - Phases

## Preparation Phase (4 weeks)

In line with the organization's vision and strategy the purpose of the preparation phase is to have an initial rough plan for each single release in terms of content and deadlines. This involves identifying technical topics (architecture, software development, (new) features and updates) as well as associated standards that are to be implemented.

## Planning (10 weeks)

The planning phase deals with the concrete planning of the content of the individual releases. Based on the association roadmap, the topics in the product backlog and the previous rough planning, the detailed refinement work now begins. The aim of the planning is to ensure that the content is specified, prioritized, scheduled, committed and then released at the end of the phase.

## Development & Release (15 weeks)

The development and release phase includes the development of the software and standards. The individual units are developed and tested in up to six increments. This is followed by final integration and end-to-end testing for the software. In addition there is an opt-out phase for commenting on the developed standards (45 days). If successful the individual units will be released and published.

## Release Management

Catena-X **Release Management** is a crucial component within the broader Catena-X ecosystem, focused on orchestrating and overseeing the release cycles of both Catena-X and Tractus-X. Here's an overview of how Catena-X Release Management operates and coordinates these releases:

### Purpose of Catena-X Release Management

- **Streamlining Releases**: Catena-X Release Management aims to streamline the process of releasing updates, upgrades, and new features for both Catena-X and Tractus-X.
- **Ensuring Compatibility**: It ensures that releases across different components are compatible and seamlessly integrate with each other.
- **Quality Assurance**: Quality assurance and testing are integral parts, ensuring that released versions meet high standards of performance, security, and reliability.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Release Planning**: This involves strategizing the timing and content of releases based on development milestones, customer feedback, and market demands.
- **Version Control**: Managing versioning across different components to maintain clarity and consistency across software, standards and deployment.
- **Coordination with Development Teams**: Collaborating closely with development teams across Expert Groups, Committees and the broader Open Source community to align on release schedules, feature prioritization, and bug fixes.
- **Testing and QA**: Overseeing comprehensive testing processes to identify and address issues before deployment (see ##Test Management).
- **Documentation and Communication**: Ensuring that release notes, documentation, and communication channels are updated and accessible to stakeholders.

### Coordination with Catena-X and Tractus-X

- **Catena-X Integration**: Coordinating releases between Catena-X and Tractus-X involves understanding the dependencies and interactions between both components of our ecosystem.
- **Feature Alignment**: Ensuring that standards developed for Catena-X and features & KITs developed for Tractus-X are aligned with overarching goals and customer requirements.
- **Interoperability**: Guaranteeing interoperability between Catena-X standards and Tractus-X features, such as reference implementations to facilitate seamless data exchange and functionality.

### Release Lifecycle

- **Preparation Phase**: Developing and communicating the overarching release timeline including relevant milestones to all stakeholders across Tractus-X and Catena-X.
- **Planning Phase**: Identifying release goals, feature prioritization, and creating a roadmap for implementation.
- **Development Phase**: Actively working with development teams to build and test new features and enhancements.
- **Testing and QA Phase**: Conducting rigorous testing, including integration testing between Catena-X and Tractus-X elements.
- **Deployment Phase**: Deploying releases to production environments while ensuring minimal disruption and downtime. While Catena-X is responsible for providing governance and guidelines for deployments, the actual deployment to productive environments lies within the responsibility of our Operating Companies and participants of the Catena-X Data Space.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: Monitoring post-release performance, gathering feedback from users, and iterating for continuous improvement.

### Benefits of Catena-X Release Management

- **Efficiency**: Streamlining release processes leads to faster time-to-market for new features and updates.
- **Quality Assurance**: Rigorous testing and QA practices enhance the overall quality and reliability of software releases.
- **Alignment**: Ensures alignment with business objectives, customer needs, and industry standards.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and mitigation of risks associated with releases.

In essence, Catena-X Release Management acts as a central hub that coordinates the complex interplay between Catena-X and Tractus-X releases, ensuring smooth integration, high-quality deliverables, and customer satisfaction.
