title: Feature proposal creation

## ToDo's

1. **Create new feature proposal**: Anybody can contribute to a use case by [creating a feature proposal](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new/choose) in Tractus X. The person creating the feature proposal is the 'Feature Author' and is going to be responsbile for the feature proposal through the process. The feature author has to continuously refine the feature until it contains the minimal feature content, so that it can be validated. This step might be obsolete if all information are added when creating the feature proposal.
2. **Check strategic fit**: Once the feature proposal contains at least the minimal feature content, its strategic fit is going to be evaluated by the topic owner (either a committee or an expert group). If:
   - the feature proposal strategically fits the status is going to be set to _Inbox_.
   - if the topic owner assess the feature proposal as not fitting the strategy, the feature proposal is going to be rejected. In this case the feature proposal is not going to be implemented.
