# Planning (Week 5 -14)

The planning phase deals with the concrete planning of the content of the individual releases. Based on the association roadmap, the topics in the product backlog and the previous rough planning, the refinement work now begins. The aim of the planning is to ensure that the content is specified, prioritized, scheduled, committed and released at the end of the phase.
