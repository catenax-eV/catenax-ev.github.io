# Standard Planning Days

:::warning[TIP]
A two-day planning workshop to align the upcoming activities in regards to Standards.  
:::

The Standard Planning Days are dedicated sessions where all planned work on standards is reviewed and discussed. Teams identify [dependencies](https://jschuetz88.github.io/cx-dependencies), address potential issues, and ensure alignment across use cases. The goal is to prepare and validate upcoming changes, ensuring a smoother approval process by the TC4S. These days serve as the final opportunity to coordinate and finalize plans before moving forward with formal submissions.

To enter the Open Planning a feature proposal must meet the DoE X days before the Open Planning (Cut-Off)! Feature proposal that meet the DoE after the Cut-Off won't be considered in the Open Planning. This means it will likely be deferred to a future release.
