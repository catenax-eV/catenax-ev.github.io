# Catena-X Body of Knowledge (CX BOK)

## Welcome to the CX BOK

The Catena-X Body of Knowledge (CX BOK) is a comprehensive collection of domain-specific knowledge, conceptual frameworks, and technical deep-dives that support the implementation and understanding of the Catena-X ecosystem.

:::info Purpose
The CX BOK provides in-depth knowledge about key concepts, workflows, and architectural patterns that are essential for understanding how Catena-X works beyond the normative standards.
:::

## What is the CX BOK?

While [Standards](/docs/standards/overview) define **what must be implemented**, and [Architecture Guardrails](../architecture-guardrails/overview.md) define **how to structure solutions**, the CX BOK explains **why things work the way they do** and provides the **conceptual foundation** for the ecosystem.

### CX BOK vs. Standards

| Aspect | CX BOK | Standards |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Nature** | Informative, educational | Normative, prescriptive |
| **Purpose** | Understanding & learning | Compliance & interoperability |
| **Content** | Concepts, workflows, patterns | Requirements, specifications |
| **Audience** | Architects, developers, analysts | Implementers, certifiers |
| **Changes** | Evolves with ecosystem knowledge | Formal versioning & governance |

## Structure

The CX BOK is organized into thematic areas:

### 🔐 Identity & Trust

Documentation on identity management, trust frameworks, and authentication mechanisms.

- [Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Workflow](./ssi-workflow)
- [Issuer Concept and Credential Management](./issuer-concept)
- Verifiable Credentials in Catena-X
- Trust Anchors and Governance

### 📊 Data Sovereignty & Exchange

Concepts related to data sovereignty, data exchange patterns, and connector architecture.

- Data Sovereignty Principles
- Connector Architecture Patterns
- Policy Enforcement Mechanisms
- Data Contract Negotiation

### 🔄 Semantic Interoperability

Deep dives into semantic models, ontologies, and data harmonization.

- Aspect Model Design Patterns
- Ontology Usage in Catena-X
- Semantic Model Lifecycle
- Data Mapping and Transformation

### 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

Common architectural patterns and best practices for Catena-X applications.

- Microservices in Catena-X
- Event-Driven Architecture
- API Gateway Patterns
- Resilience and Fault Tolerance

### 🔍 Use Case Deep Dives

Detailed explorations of specific use cases and their implementations.

- Traceability Use Case Architecture
- PCF (Product Carbon Footprint) Workflow
- Digital Product Pass Implementation
- Quality Management Patterns

## How to Use the CX BOK

:::tip For Architects
Use the CX BOK to understand the conceptual foundations and design patterns that inform your architecture decisions. The BOK provides the "why" behind the architectural choices in Catena-X.
:::

:::tip For Developers
Refer to the CX BOK for detailed workflows, sequence diagrams, and implementation guidance that complements the normative standards. The BOK helps you understand how components interact.
:::

:::tip For Business Analysts
The CX BOK explains business concepts and workflows in technical detail, helping bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.
:::

:::tip For Newcomers
Start with the CX BOK to build foundational knowledge about Catena-X before diving into specific standards or implementation work.
