<p>The success of the digital transformation of the automotive industry critically depends on multilateral collaboration between all stakeholders along the automotive value chain. Our growing Catena-X ecosystem will enable enormous amounts of data to be integrated and collaboratively harnessed.</p>
<p>However, this vision is complex: companies at various stages of the automotive value chain, such as production, delivery, or logistics, often have their own IT systems to manage their data. To ensure that these complex data volumes can be sent, received, and processed smoothly across all stages of the value chain, we need one language for all players: <strong>common standards and frameworks</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-we-standardize">What do we standardize?<a href="#what-do-we-standardize" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What do we standardize?" title="Direct link to What do we standardize?">​</a></h3>
<p>The standards of our Catena-X data ecosystem define how the exchange of data and information in our network works. They are the basis for ensuring that the technologies, components, policies, and processes used are developed and operated according to uniform rules. All standards developed for the Catena-X data ecosystem are based on the technological and industry-specific requirements of the automotive industry.</p>
<p>The Catena-X Association publishes standards for generic core and enabling services as well as for domain-specific business applications (see KITs Chapter <a href="/docs/operating-model/what-service-map#kits--keep-it-together">KITs – Keep It Together</a>). These standards and artifacts form the basis for the development and operation of software components in the Catena-X network to ensure interoperability and data sovereignty between different software components and providers. All relevant standards are accessible in the <a href="/docs/standards/overview">Catena-X standard library</a>.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/user_upload/Vereinsdokumente/Catena-X_IP_Regelwerk_IP_Regulations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catena-X’s Intellectual Property(IP)-Regulations</a> and in compliance with applicable antitrust law, the Catena-X standardization process aims to develop and implement uniform standards for networking and data exchange in the automotive sector. A general overview of the process is depicted in Figure <a href="/docs/operating-model/how-data-space-governance#how-do-we-standardize">Catena-X Standardization Process</a>:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://catena-x.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/standardisierung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catena-X Website</a> provides a detailed description of how Catena-X standards are being developed including everyone involved and their respective responsibilities.</p>

<p>Cross company interactions highly rely on mutual trust. Catena-X issues certifications in order to provide trust via transparency and reliability based on our Catena-X standards. By setting up a certification process, we guarantee that our major principles are considered in every component of the network. Independent of size and role, core service providers or small application, a consistent framework was created to ensure beneficial participation for all participants in the network. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and to gain trust we need to ensure that all links are as strong as possible by encouraging the consistent use of standards and providing a quality label to those who do.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-we-certify">What do we certify?<a href="#what-do-we-certify" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What do we certify?" title="Direct link to What do we certify?">​</a></h3>
<p>Catena-X certification is done in a modular, role-based way, to fulfill different requirements of participants in our ecosystem, whether IT application providers, service providers or onboarding partners. The modularity allows high flexibility and lowers the efforts and redundancies for all parties involved. The certification framework details all standards a company has to comply with based on their role, the goal of their service and the use-case in which they participate e.g. PLM &amp; Quality, Sustainability, Resiliency. Catena-X standards become mandatory for certification as soon as they have been integrated into the certification framework. The Catena-X Association aims to release an update of its certification framework simultaneously with newly released standards. The most current version can always be found on the <a href="https://catena-x.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catena-X website</a>.</p>

<p>Certifications and qualifications at Catena-X can be obtained for different types of services or solutions. The certifications are split into different &quot;roles&quot; indicating the type of relationship to Catena-X, as well as the&quot;module&quot;, the specific service provided. The roles of certified companies vary between the provision of a key part of infrastructure or service ( Enablement Service Provider or Core Service provider) and complementing further solutions or services to the data space. In line with this role differentiation, the certifications have a different scope and different Catena-X standards associated with them.
Companies shall always mention the specific role and module they have been awarded the certification in e.g. Connector, Traceability, MaaS... .</p>

<p>Each certified partner needs to ensure conformity to the standards to be active in the data space. Every certified participant in the data space has the obligation to remain compatible with at least one of the supported ecosystem releases through certification via a CAB. If there is no valid certificate after the ecosystem release tied to the respective certificate expires, Partners lose the status of certification/ qualification and are no longer listed as such on the Data Space Clearance List after the above mentioned 120 days of grace period expire. Each label is obtained after successful completion of the Catena-X certification or qualification process.</p>

<p>Jupiter is the next ecosystem release of the Catena-X data ecosystem. For the first time, all major components of the Catena-X data ecosystem will be updated for all active and future users of the network. To offer a smooth transition to all our stakeholders to a new major release, certain measures are taken during the transitional period:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-self-assessment-to-maintain-valid-certification-after-release-2405">1. Self-Assessment to maintain valid certification after Release 24.05<a href="#1-self-assessment-to-maintain-valid-certification-after-release-2405" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Self-Assessment to maintain valid certification after Release 24.05" title="Direct link to 1. Self-Assessment to maintain valid certification after Release 24.05">​</a></h4>
<p>Catena-X will release a standard update (Preview Jupiter) in June 2024, on the Catena-X Association website. <strong>This release will include “breaking changes” as defined in the</strong> <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>
<p>The productive environment of the Catena-X data ecosystem (productive environment) will be <strong>exclusively on Release Jupiter</strong>. This will be accompanied by an <strong>update of the certification framework</strong> (“which role needs to have which components certified”).</p>
<p>Each partner needs to ensure conformity to the new standards to be active in the data space. To this end, the following procedure applies: Every participant in the data space has until <strong>October 2024</strong> (grace period) to complete their certification via a CAB or, in case of an existing certification, via free self-assessment. If there is no valid certificate for Jupiter, Partners must be removed from the data space at the direction of the Catena-X Association as of October 16th 2024.</p>
<p>Data space participants and their solutions that have a valid certificate past October 2024 can use the period between the standard update in June 2024 and the industrialization of Jupiter via the Operating Company to prove their compliance to the Association via a <strong>free self-assessment</strong> and thus confirm the validity of their certificate even after release updates (up to a maximum of 12 months after initial issue). A corresponding form including confirmation of conformity with each standard required for the certificate can be requested from <a href="mailto:info@catena-x.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@catena-x.net</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A business application</strong> provides specific logic and schemas defined in a Catena-X use case (e.g., data processing, transformation functions) that is applied to input data to produce an expected output. This includes the use of Catena-X semantic models (semantic interoperability) as well as the technical data exchange using standardized protocols and API-specifications (technical interoperability). This does not apply to internal systems of an organization, such as internal databases, data lakes, data pipelines (ETL) or source systems.</p>
<p>Companies may want to <strong>integrate internal systems</strong> including company-internal business applications to the Catena-X data space. However, it is crucial that all participants can rely on a standardized data exchange to ensure stable and consistent multi-tier data chains based on data sovereignty and interoperability. Consequently, the following principles apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>All company-internal business applications required to maintain a stable and consistent multi-tier data must comply with Catena-X standards and be certified by a CAB.</li>
<li>All company-internal business applications associated with the Catena-X brand and/or offered on a Catena-X marketplace must comply to Catena-X standards and be certified by a CAB.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an company-internal business application meets either of these criteria, Catena-X certification is mandatory.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-no-catena-x-business-applications-without-listing-on-a-certified-catena-x-marketplace">3.

<p>Catena-X is built on trust. All Catena-X certified business applications and services must be listed on a certified Catena-X marketplace.
Catena-X marketplace provider (i.e. CSP-A) verify that the listed business applications and services have a valid certification issued by a CAB and therefore comply with the Catena-X standards. Catena-X does not allow the provision of a solutions without a marketplace listing.</p>
<p>In the future, there will be multiple CSP-As that enable business applications and services to be verified and listed on various marketplaces, as mentioned in chapter <a href="/docs/operating-model/outlook#increase-decentralization-of-core-services">Increase Decentralization of Core Services</a>.</p>

<p>On the way to creating value with Catena-X, companies may be dependent on advisory services. The quality of these advisory services is decisive for the success of the participation and thus for the success of Catena-X. Catena-X can only be successful if it succeeds in integrating large parts of the automotive value chain. We assume that this will lead to a high demand for advisory services, which must be met. These advisory services must cover the needs of small and medium-sized companies as well as the needs of large companies, which have extended integration requirements.</p>
<p>Advisory services are hard, if not impossible, to standardize. Consequently, conformity assessment of qualified advisory services cannot take place through certification. To maintain a consistent level of quality among advisory service providers in the Catena-X data space, the Catena-X Association thus offers a qualification process that is mandatory for all advisory service providers who want to get listed in a marketplace. Advisory service providers, like all other participants active in the Catena-X data space, must adhere to the Catena-X regulatory framework and thereby confirm their full and unconditional support of our data ecosystem including its mission and standards.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-do-we-qualify">Who do we qualify?<a href="#who-do-we-qualify" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who do we qualify?" title="Direct link to Who do we qualify?">​</a></h3>
<p>Catena-X invites advisory service providers of all kinds to support the successful onboarding of data space participants, SMEs in particular. One of the few prerequisites is the binding commitment to provide high-quality consulting at fair and reasonable costs. Catena-X supports this endeavor with information and predefined content as well as a qualification system to prove appropriate support and consulting competencies.</p>
<p>Different from Catena-X Certification, Catena-X qualification is a label held by an individual. Individuals passing the assessment process and being awarded the title &quot;Qualified Advisor&quot; may refer to themselves as <code>Catena-X qualified</code>. Companies with more than 5 employees with this qualification may refer to their entire company as <code>Catena-X qualified</code>. Alternatively, if more than 50% of a company&#x27;s staff is qualified, it may equally refer to the entire company as <code>Catena-X qualified</code>. Any <code>Catena-X qualified</code> label has a validity of 12 months.</p>

<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://catena-x.academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catena-X Campus</a>, Catena-X offers dedicated training to all interested advisory service providers. To gain the label <em>Qualified Advisor</em> on the Catena-X ecosystem, the successful completion of the <em>Consultant Qualification</em> on the <em>Training Area</em> of the Catena-X Campus is a prerequisite. This dedicated training covers all aspects relevant to advising users of the Catena-X data ecosystem, from topics concerning business impact to questions on operations &amp; governance.</p>
<p>The Catena-X qualification process is under constant development and further, specialized modules including dedicated labels will be published soon.</p>

<p>Catena-X issues four different labels to indicate a company has been successfully certified or qualified and is compliant with Catena-X standards. This is in order to help customers find suitable and legitimate providers who have been assessed to comply with Catena-X standards or qualification requirements.
Each label is issued to the relevant role after achieving successful certification and/or qualification. Labels are associated with the offered services of the provider as stated in the certification framework on the  <a href="https://catena-x.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catena-X website</a>.</p>

<p>Both certification and qualification awards the right to hold and use a label with either the word &quot;qualified&quot; or a specific title combining the words &quot;qualified&quot; or &quot;certified&quot; with a role description. Labels are only to be used upon a successful completion of the certification/ qualification process. Certificates are bound to an ecosystem release, e.g. Jupiter and expire the moment, an ecosystem release is outdated (lifecycle state = deprecated). To maintain a valid label,  a certification for one of the subsequent ecosystem releases has to be completed. The use of older terminologies and visuals are not permitted and are therefore to be phased out within a transition period of three months since the latest release of this document, Catena-X Operating Model. Furthermore, companies shall solely use the name of the label for their role (certified operating company/ certified provider/ certified solution or respectively qualified advisor) as specified in the Catena-X Certification Framework or Regulatory Framework.
Companies or advisors are solely liable for providing the services. The certification does not provide any warranties of the quality of the work and the services of the certified companies or qualified advisor.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="regulatory-framework">Regulatory Framework<a href="#regulatory-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Regulatory Framework" title="Direct link to Regulatory Framework">​</a></h2>
<p>The Catena-X Regulatory Framework for data space operations outlines the non-technical requirements and responsibilities for all stakeholders involved in the Catena-X data ecosystem. It includes detailed information on data sovereignty, mandatory use case requirements, and other regulatory considerations that are relevant and mandatory to our activities. The Regulatory Framework is made up of individual components that each govern a specific layer of our data space operations. Find all the details about the Regulatory Framework <a href="/docs/regulatory-framework/governance-framework">here</a>.</p>
<p>To understand the layers of our Regulatory Framework, Catena-X uses flight levels as a metaphor (see Figure Catena-X Governance Framework flight levels):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Catena-X Flightlevels" src="/assets/images/catena-x-governance-framework-flight-levels-eb3e47026bd2885a5180e41e529b5dd3.png" width="1701" height="662" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Catena-X Flightlevels</em></p>
<p>The Operating Model, the 10 Golden Rules and the Country Clearance List fall under the 30,000-ft level (Data Space Level) and are thus mandatory for all data space participants. At this level, the basic principles of the data ecosystem are outlined.</p>
<p>The Data Exchange Governance and the standardised usage policies are located at the 20,000-ft level (Use Case Level), where the fundamental requirements for data usage in a use case are defined.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer: The Data Exchange Governance is only temporarily located at this level. It will soon be located at the 30,000-ft level.</strong></em></p>
<p>The 10,000-ft level (Data Offering Level) provides guidance for data offerings by Data Providers and Consumers.</p>
<p>The 5,000-ft level provides guidance for data usage by Data Providers and Consumers including the conclusion of contracts via a registered connector.</p>
<p>Each higher level cascades into the lower ones, and the lower levels align with those above. Each level comes with specific guidelines and resources but also responsibilities for participants in our data space. Maintaining and updating our Regulatory Framework for data space operations lies within the responsibility of the Catena-X Association.
All resources and normative documents included in the regulatory framework are listed on the Catena-X website.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="standardized-modules-for-data-exchange-contracts">Standardized modules for data exchange contracts<a href="#standardized-modules-for-data-exchange-contracts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Standardized modules for data exchange contracts" title="Direct link to Standardized modules for data exchange contracts">​</a></h3>
<p>The Catena-X Association aims to develop further automation and scalability of the process of concluding data exchange contracts via Catena-X. Connectors will enable participants to choose from a range of modules when negotiating and agreeing on terms within the Data Exchange Governance (e.g. liability/dispute resolution/choice of law etc.). All official modules provided by the Catena-X Association are listed under the official Catena-X Open Digital Rights Language Repository.
These modules are limited to standardized data usage policies for Catena-X use cases.</p>

<p>The Catena-X Data Space enables Data Providers and Data Consumers to conclude data exchange contracts via registered connectors.
While Data Providers and Data Consumers have the option of concluding bilateral contracts (supplier contract, ...) outside of a registered connector to determine their contractual relationship for data exchange via Catena-X, the Catena-X Regulatory Framework sets out certain boundary conditions (10 Golden Rules, Data Exchange Governance...) that are binding for all data space participants and cannot be negated with bilateral contracts outside the confines of the Catena-X Regulatory Framework.
These boundary conditions, combined with the possibility to automate data exchange contract negotiations, form one of the key benefits and foundations for scaling of the Catena-X Data Space. For more information on how to conclude data exchange contracts via Catena-X, please refer to the Catena-X memorandum on how to conclude data exchange contracts.</p>

<p>Standardized contractual modules, as all parts of the Catena-X Regulatory Framework, are categorized as so-called <strong>Non-Technical Requirements</strong> (vs. technical requirements = <strong>standards</strong>). All Non-Technical Requirements are not subject to the technical Catena-X standardization process, governed by the Catena-X Technical Committee for Standardization, but are rather developed under the auspices of the formally responsible Committee (e.g. Catena-X Data Space Operations Committee for standardized contractual modules) and are formally approved by the Catena-X Management Board. This process mirrors the technical standardization process in order to provide accessibility, transparency and ease of understanding and differs mainly in the actors involved as governing bodies.</p>
<p>A general overview of the process is depicted in Figure <a href="/docs/operating-model/how-data-space-governance#governance-for-non-technical-requirements">Catena-X process for Non-Technical Requirements</a>:</p>

<p>An effective governance model requires clear guidelines and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that all participants comply with the agreed normative documents. This chapter focuses on how the Catena-X association proceeds if participants violate the rules and guidelines set out in the Catena-X governance framework. It describes the processes and measures that are taken to ensure compliance and to ensure that the trust and integrity of the network are maintained.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-we-monitor-violations">How do we monitor violations?<a href="#how-do-we-monitor-violations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do we monitor violations?" title="Direct link to How do we monitor violations?">​</a></h3>
<p>The following chapter describes how monitoring generally takes place and what categories there are. The exact implementation can be found in chapter <a href="/docs/operating-model/how-data-space-governance#implementation-and-set-up">Implementation and set-up</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Active Monitoring</strong><br>
<!-- -->Active monitoring encompasses proactive measures to detect and address potential violations promptly. This involves checks of certificates within the network and among participants, and regular feedback collection from OSPs, CSPs and CABs regarding the certification status of their users. By actively engaging in these monitoring activities, the Catena-X community can swiftly identify deviations from established normative documents and take corrective actions to maintain compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Passive Monitoring</strong><br>
<!-- -->In addition to active oversight, the Catena-X Association provides a passive monitoring gateway where participants can report violations within the Catena-X data space. This point of contact serves as a confidential channel for data space participants to raise concerns or flag instances of non-compliance observed within the ecosystem. By fostering a culture of accountability and transparency, Catena-X encourages all stakeholders to actively participate in upholding the integrity of the data space.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-consequences-of-such-violations">What are the consequences of such violations?<a href="#what-are-the-consequences-of-such-violations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the consequences of such violations?" title="Direct link to What are the consequences of such violations?">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Withdrawal of Certificates and Certification</strong><br>
<!-- -->At the foundational level, non-compliant participants face the withdrawal of their certificates and certification status. This action signifies the removal of official recognition for adhering to Catena-X standards, signaling a loss of credibility within the ecosystem. Furthermore, it limits the actions of the given party. Without a certificate, it&#x27;s e.g. no longer possible to provide business apps as a BAP or participate in a use case as a DPC.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion from Data Space Clearance List and Data Space Access</strong><br>
<!-- -->Participants found in violation of normative documents may be excluded from the Catena-X Data Space Clearance List, effectively barring them from accessing the data space and limiting their ability to engage in data exchange activities within the Catena-X data space. Further details about the Data Space Clearance List can be found in chapter <a href="/docs/operating-model/how-data-space-governance#implementation-and-set-up">Implementation and set-up</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature and severity of the violation, a combination of consequences may be applied to address the non-compliance effectively. The Catena-X Association is further developing the consequences described and investigating further possibilities. Details can be found in the chapter <a href="/docs/operating-model/outlook#enforcement-of-compliance-with-normative-documents">outlook</a>.</p>

<p>As described in Chapter <a href="/docs/operating-model/how-data-space-governance#how-do-we-monitor-violations">How do we monitor violations</a>, there are two input channels on which the Catena-X Association can receive various information.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="active-monitoring">Active Monitoring<a href="#active-monitoring" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Active Monitoring" title="Direct link to Active Monitoring">​</a></h4>
<p>For active monitoring, there is a public list showing all certified parties and apps. This list can be found <a href="https://catenax-ev.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certified Catena-X Solutions &amp; Participants</a>. This list of certified parties and solutions is updated by two roles:</p>

<p>The OSP enables and supports data space participants to register, onboard and offboard to the Catena-X data space. The OSP is required to add every company successfully onboarded to the productive Catena-X data space in the Catena-X data space clearance list. This ensures, that the Data Space Clearance List contains all data space participants regardless by which OSP they were onboarded.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cab---conformity-assessment-body">CAB - Conformity Assessment Body<a href="#cab---conformity-assessment-body" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CAB - Conformity Assessment Body" title="Direct link to CAB - Conformity Assessment Body">​</a></h5>
<p>The CAB is responsible for adding all certificates that are being issued to the list. This provides a clear overview of solutions that are certified and who got certified. On the one hand, this creates a clear overview of all solutions certified by Catena-X and on the other hand also the possibility of comparing whether a participant offers a solution that is still certified.</p>

<p>With this version of the operating model we will only establish the process (e.g. add Solutions and participants to the Data Space Clearance List) and tools (e.g. Data Space Clearance List) mentioned above. The consequences of violations, as described in the chapter <a href="/docs/operating-model/how-data-space-governance#what-are-the-consequences-of-such-violations">What are the consequences of such violations</a>, will be further refined and elaborated upon.</p>

<p>The nomination process is intended to ensure neutrality and trustworthy execution of selected roles and tasks within the Catena-X ecosystem. The Catena-X Association is responsible for the execution of the nomination process including partner selection.</p>
<p>The various rights and obligations of the provider are described in the Request for Tender (RFT). This is, for example, the license for operation, which can also be withdrawn in case of unfair behavior. This ensures fair awarding and safe operation of the various components. Tasks include, for example, the operation of Core Services - Section B by Core Service Providers or the certification of providers and solutions by CABs. An overview of the nomination process is depicted in Figure <a href="/docs/operating-model/how-data-space-governance#nomination-process-for-unique-roles-eg-csp-b">Catena-X Nomination Process</a>.</p>
