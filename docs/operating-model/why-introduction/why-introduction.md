# Why: Introduction

## Relevance

The Catena-X Operating Model Whitepaper is a normative document of the Catena-X Association. Normative documents outline rules, guidelines, and characteristics for activities and results for all participants within the Catena-X ecosystem. The Catena-X ecosystem includes Governance, Standardization, Certification, Development and Operations. These are established by consensus among the working groups and approved by the executive board of the Catena-X Association. As part of the Catena-X regulatory framework, this document is binding for all participants of the Catena-X ecosystem. This normative document is a foundational building block, allowing all participants to collaborate within a global ecosystem.

## Executive Summary

### Introduction

With Catena-X, the automotive industry is creating targets for a trustworthy, collaborative, open, and secure data space to enable a data-driven value chain for their relevant business processes. All participants can be connected in business process-centric end-to-end value chains, where everyone operates on an equal playing field, has sovereign control over their data and no lock-in effects occur. Thereby, the digitalization of intercompany processes and value chains, especially those of small and medium-sized companies, can be performed on a cost-effective, timely, and lasting basis. Further, it ensures that market participants and competitors collaborate in a compliant and trusted way.

### Objectives

This document defines the operating model and processes required within the Catena-X ecosystem. The operating model is linked to the concepts and values of Gaia-X and the International Data Space Association (IDSA) to create the first open and collaborative data ecosystem for the automotive value chain. Thereby, Catena-X applies these concepts and extends them by integrating automotive-specific requirements for compliance, interoperability, and security. The operating model lays the foundation and is the pre-requisite for further standardization, certification, implementation, and operations of software components and partners in the Catena-X data space. The operating model is continuously updated to reflect the evolution of business and regulatory requirements, as well as emerging technologies.

### Scope

The Catena-X operating model describes the entire Catena-X ecosystem, focusing on the operating environment and its roles, processes, and solutions, and how they interact. Since Catena-X is under continuous development, the document refers, where appropriate, to dynamic content that can be found on the website of the Catena-X Association.

## Document updates

The Catena-X Association releases updates to its operating model in regular intervals to always guarantee a well-functioning, up-to-date framework for its data space operations. Updates are developed within the framework regulations of the Catena-X Association and require approval from the Associationâ€™s executive board. Every update of this operating model will automatically be applied to all Catena-X initiatives, existing participants, and doesn't require individual approval. An update will be communicated in due time via the Catena-X Association.
