# Who: Roles in the Catena-X ecosystem

The Catena-X ecosystem operates on the principle of multiple distinct roles, designed to create an appealing and functional data space (see Figure [Role Overview and Relationships](./who-roles-in-the-catena-x-ecosystem.md#overview-of-roles)). Participants can take on one or more roles in any combination, and multiple participants can fulfill the same role except for the CSP-B role. The CSP-B role can only exist once in the data space due to complexity and technical reasons. Provider roles receive a label through a certification or qualification process to demonstrate that they are trusted partners (see Chapter [How: Life Cycle Management](./../how-life-cycle-management/how-life-cycle-management.md)).

## Overview of roles

*Role Overview and Relationships*

## Detailed description of each role

Below, each role that a participant can assume in the Catena-X data spaces is described in detail, along with its assigned description, responsibilities, relationships, prerequisites, and complements. Please refer to Chapter  [What: Service Map](./../what-service-map/what-service-map.md) for an overview of the Service Map.

### Core Service Provider A

**Role:** Core Service Provider A (CSP-A)

**Description/Responsibilities**: A CSP-A is responsible for deploying, operating, and maintaining core services A according to Catena-X standards. Core Services A provides common business functionalities for all data space participants (e.g., managing marketplace offers, semantic models, or searching for business partner information).  

A CSP-A can operate various bundles of Core Services A, whereby the operation of an IAM and a marketplace is mandatory. Note that the synchronization of marketplace offers is at the discretion of a provider, who may submit and list its offer on multiple marketplaces. The CSP-A role can be taken on by multiple participants.  

For smooth operations, the CSP-A must provide comprehensive technical documentation, along with first, second, and third-level support to facilitate integration with its services. Each CSP-A has freedom of choice regarding their business model towards their potential customers.

**Relationships:**

- A CSP-A **must** implement an IAM synchronization and must integrate with
other CSP-As.

- A CSP-A **must** accept any certified solution that wants to be listed on its marketplace in accordance with its respective terms and conditions, without discriminating against individual organizations.

**Prerequisites:**

- A CSP-A and its services must be certified by a CAB
- A CSP-A must accept and comply with the Catena-X regulatory framework
during onboarding via one of the OSPs.

**Current Limitations:**

- Due to technical limitations, the CSP-A role currently cannot be fully assumed and executed more than once. Further details can be found in Chapter [Increase Decentralization of Core Services](./../outlook/outlook.md#increase-decentralization-of-core-services) or can be requested during the conformity assessment.

### Core Service Provider B

**Role:** Core Service Provider B (CSP-B)

**Description/Responsibilities**: The CSP-B is responsible for deploying, operating, and maintaining all core services section B according to Catena-X standards. Core Services B include identity and common accessibility and discoverability functionalities for all data space participants.

The CSP-B operates all Core Services B as one bundle to enable trusted participation and sovereign data exchange across all data space participants. The CSP-B role can only be taken on by one participant and is nominated by the Catena-X Association to operate and further develop the services on their behalf.

### Sandbox Provider (BETA)

**Role:** Sandbox Provider (SP)

**Description/Responsibilities**:

A Sandbox Provider is responsible for deploying, operating, and maintaining a Catena-X Sandbox according to Catena-X standards. A Catena-X Sandbox includes all CSP-B and OSP components required to provide a functioning Catena-X operating environment see also Chapter [What-Service Map](./../what-service-map/what-service-map.md) for more details. An SP operates the Sandbox as one bundle of services to enable coherent testing of sovereign data exchange and services across all basic data space functionalities. Please take a look at the chapter Service map for a complete description of Catena-X Sandboxes.

For smooth operations, an SP must provide comprehensive technical documentation and first, second, and third-level support to facilitate integration with its services. Each SP has freedom of choice regarding their business model towards their potential customers.

Given that the Catena-X brand derives much of its value throug trust, Catena-X Sandboxes must only accept trusted users that went through the official Catena-X registration process via one of the OSPs, including the acceptance of the general Catena-X terms and conditions (10 golden rules, data exchange governance...). As Sandboxes are not directly linked to the Catena-X Operating Environment, a listing on the data space clearance list serve as proof for trusted users.

**Relationships:**

- An SP can operate independently from the CSP-B as Catena-X Sandboxes remain strictly separate from the Catena-X Operating Environment.
- An SP must only onboard trusted users, listed on the Catena-X data space clearance list.
- An SP must advertise a clear migration path to the productive Catena-X Operating Environment to its users.
- An SP must use the services of one of the OSPs to register and onboard itself to the data space (e.g., registration service).
- An SP must accept and comply with the Catena-X regulatory framework during onboarding via one of the OSPs.
- An SP offering its Sandbox to official Catena-X conformity assessment services must be nominated by the Catena-X Association.

**Prerequisites and Limitations:**

- As a BETA service, an SP and its services must not yet be certified by a CAB. Instead, operating a Catena-X Sandbox requires specific approval from the Catena-X Association and the signing of a self-assessment.
- Any approval granted to operate a Catena-X Sandbox is limited until October 2024.
- An SP is responsible for upholding certification verifications and checks for compliance with the Catena-X governance framework, given that a direct connection with the CSP-B is currently infeasible. Thereby, the Catena-X Association and the CSP-B are also not responsible or liable for any SLAs provided by the SP.
