In the knowledge agent approach, ontologies are used to describe the semantics of data. Ontologies are similar to data models or data schemas in which the semantics and structure of data are described. In addition, ontologies provide a high degree of semantic expressiveness, i.e. formal semantics. This means that there is a logical system behind the ontologies. This allows automatic inference on data like "p-123" is_a part & part is_a physical object => "p-123" is_a physical object. Such inference enables strong typing of data. In this way,the machine can understand the meaning of the vocabulary \'part\', that it is a physical object and not a document part or a design model part. It could be that the same vocabularies are used for different things in different data models. The formal semantics of ontologies prevent such misunderstandings in data caused by synonymity or homonymity, etc. and lead to better collaboration and interoperability among data space participants. On the other hand, the ontology-based approach represents the underlying data in assets as a graph structure.

The Semantic Web is the semantic extension of the Web. In the Web, the content of Web pages is exchanged in a document-based way (Web of Documents). This has the disadvantage that a direct access to a certain content of the documents is not possible. Therefore, a new concept was developed in which the contents of documents are decomposed into data and described by data models (Web of Data). At the same time, a query language was developed with which the desired content can be queried directly. In the Semantic Web, the data models are called ontologies, based on the philosophical meaning 'study of being', because the data on the Web is the digital representation of things in the real world. Semantic Web ontologies are formal languages in which data can be described unambiguously and without redundancy.
