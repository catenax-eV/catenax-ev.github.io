The issuance of the certificate is exclusively handled by a company within Catena-X holding the CX-verifiable credential 'Dismantler.' Therefore, the CoDM consistently marks the conclusion of the initial lifecycle phase of an asset, initiating the End-of-Life process. Subsequently, additional certificates provide the opportunity to commence the start of a component's second life. However, a vehicle with a specific VIN is unequivocally designated as End-of-Life. The End-of-Life-Vehicle (ELV) will be consecutive dismantled. The CE-Assistant can then be used to support the dismantling company in its decision as to which components of the ELV should be reused, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled. The assistant suggests the most ecologically and economically beneficial R-strategy for the components. The asset/part/component/material/fluid/etc. must be certified - reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishment, material recycling, waste - in accordance with the decision made. This certification makes it possible to track the life cycle of the components precisely. It also offers the advantage of being able to keep statistics on what percentage of its components have been allocated to which R-strategy. In the evaluation of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of different components and their subsequent integration into the digital twin, the precise categorization of these components across different life cycle phases is a central factor. The utilization of precisely defined end-of-life (EoL) certificates enables the accurate determination of a component's current life cycle phase. This precision not only ensures a reliable assessment, but also facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact and carbon footprint of the components, seamlessly integrating this valuable information into the digital twin framework.
