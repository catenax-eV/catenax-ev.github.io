The FMI standard provides the means to support model based development by defining ways in which models of systems and subsystems can be exchanged and connected with each other.\nThe FMI standard is key for the interoperability of simulation tools.

The FMI implementation by a software modelling tool enables the creation of simulation models that can be interconnected.

The Tier-1 develops the model of its component using any FMI compatible tool. The model is then exported as FMU. The model is now packed as a black box model. The person (for example from an OEM) who receives the simulation model can only see the input and output ports and the parameters and variables of the models that have been exposed by the model creator. In this way the intellectual properties of the model creator is protected.\nUsing the FMU format, an OEM can get models of the components needed for its vehicle from different Tier-1s already in the design phase. The models are then integrated together with the own OEM's models to build a vechicle model. The assembled model is used to run parametric studies to assess the performace of the vehicle. The same workflow is also valid for a Tier-(N+1) and its Tier-Ns.\nIn a more general approach, FMUs can be seen as services providing an output for a given input.
