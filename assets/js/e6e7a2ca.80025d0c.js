This also includes the decentralization of the issuer service and logging functionality for agreements. To further strengthen trust in the data space, we will introduce the option to define various root trust anchors (e.g., the Catena-X Association). This will also allow the identity wallet to be decentralized and allow multiple issuers. In addition, a chain of trust will be established to prove that a given credential comes from a trusted source according to the Catena-X Governance Framework.
