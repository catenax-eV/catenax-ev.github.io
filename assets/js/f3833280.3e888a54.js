The updated data objects are then available via standardized APIs."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.img,{alt:"Run Time View",src:s(60693).A+"",width:"750",height:"416"})}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"3-references",children:"3 REFERENCES"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"31-non-normative-references",children:"3.1 NON-NORMATIVE REFERENCES"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.em,{children:"This section is non-normative"})}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://catena-x.net/en/offers/bpdm",children:"BPDM Catena-X Website"})}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"32-reference-implementations",children:"3.2 REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.em,{children:"This section is non-normative"})}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/tree/fbeeb51154743e6e6700c9c7f9f4815399bce415/bpdm-pool-api/src/main/kotlin/org/eclipse/tractusx/bpdm/pool/api",children:"Business Partner Pool API"})}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/bpdm/tree/fbeeb51154743e6e6700c9c7f9f4815399bce415/bpdm-gate-api/src/main/kotlin/org/eclipse/tractusx/bpdm/gate/api",children:"Business Partner Gate API"})}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"annexes",children:"ANNEXES"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"figures",children:"FIGURES"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.em,{children:"This section is non-normative"})}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Intentionally left blank."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"tables",children:"TABLES"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(n.em,{children:"This section is non-normative"})}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Intentionally left blank."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"legal",children:"Legal"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Copyright \xa9 2025 Catena-X Automotive Network e.V.
