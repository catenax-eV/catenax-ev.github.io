Today, such short-term changes in the general conditions of the production process can often only be taken into consideration indirectly and made through manual corrections. The solution approaches in the modular production use case are aimed at increasing the flexibility of production to better leverage the existing business potential. For this purpose, services, interface, and data model definitions based on industry standards are offered with the goal of increasing the flexibility and reliability of industrial production. The shop floor is networked with the Catena-X network via the connectors standardized in Catena-X. Modular production will offer a Shop-Floor-Information-Service that supplies information about the production status and planning as needed by other partners in the Catena-X network. The goal is to enable individual production (lot size 1) at the price of series production. In particular, this is to be achieved by automating the orchestration of production resources and planning of production processes as much as possible, thus significantly reducing effort and planning times. A growth in efficiency in the sense of the OEE is achieved in that production can be reconfigured in the event of faults to continue operating as well as possible. The increased flexibility creates the space for new business models, such as the interposition of highly prioritized, lucrative orders.
